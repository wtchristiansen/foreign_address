Volodymyr Zelenskyy,Ukraine,369,12,2022,President,"Thank you so much. Thank you so much for that. Thank you. It’s too much for me. All this for our great people. Thank you so much. Dear Americans, in all states, cities and communities, all those who value freedom and justice, who cherish it as strongly as we Ukrainians in our cities, in each and every family, I hope my words of respect and gratitude resonate in each American heart. Madam Vice President, I thank you for your efforts in helping Ukraine. Madam Speaker, you bravely visited Ukraine during the full-fledged war. Thank you very much. Great honor. Thank you. I am very privileged to be here. Dear members of the Congress, representatives of both parties who also visited Kyiv, esteemed congressmen and senators from both parties who will visit Ukraine, I am sure, in the future; dear representatives of diaspora, present in this chamber, and spread across the country; dear journalists, it’s a great honor for me to be at the U.S. Congress and speak to you and all Americans. Against all odds and doom-and-gloom scenarios, Ukraine didn’t fall. Ukraine is alive and kicking. Thank you. And it gives me good reason to share with you our first, first joint victory: We defeated Russia in the battle for minds of the world. We have no fear, nor should anyone in the world have it. Ukrainians gained this victory, and it gives us courage which inspires the entire world. Americans gained this victory, and that’s why you have succeeded in uniting the global community to protect freedom and international law. Europeans gained this victory, and that’s why Europe is now stronger and more independent than ever. The Russian tyranny has lost control over us. And it will never influence our minds again. Yet, we have to do whatever it takes to ensure that countries of the Global South also gain such victory. I know one more, I think very important, thing: The Russians will stand a chance to be free only when they defeat the Kremlin in their minds. Yet, the battle continues, and we have to defeat the Kremlin on the battlefield, yes. This battle is not only for the territory, for this or another part of Europe. The battle is not only for life, freedom and security of Ukrainians or any other nation which Russia attempts to conquer. This struggle will define in what world our children and grandchildren will live, and then their children and grandchildren. It will define whether it will be a democracy of Ukrainians and for Americans — for all. This battle cannot be frozen or postponed. It cannot be ignored, hoping that the ocean or something else will provide a protection. From the United States to China, from Europe to Latin America, and from Africa to Australia, the world is too interconnected and interdependent to allow someone to stay aside and at the same time to feel safe when such a battle continues. Our two nations are allies in this battle. And next year will be a turning point, I know it, the point when Ukrainian courage and American resolve must guarantee the future of our common freedom, the freedom of people who stand for their values. Ladies and gentlemen — ladies and gentlemen, Americans, yesterday before coming here to Washington, D.C., I was at the front line in our Bakhmut. In our stronghold in the east of Ukraine, in the Donbas. The Russian military and mercenaries have been attacking Bakhmut nonstop since May. They have been attacking it day and night, but Bakhmut stands. Last year — last year, 70,000 people lived here in Bakhmut, in this city, and now only few civilians stay. Every inch of that land is soaked in blood; roaring guns sound every hour. Trenches in the Donbas change hands several times a day in fierce combat, and even hand fighting. But the Ukrainian Donbas stands. Russians — Russians use everything, everything they have against Bakhmut and other our beautiful cities. The occupiers have a significant advantage in artillery. They have an advantage in ammunition. They have much more missiles and planes than we ever had. It’s true, but our defense forces stand. And — and we all are proud of them. The Russians’ tactic is primitive. They burn down and destroy everything they see. They sent thugs to the front lines. They sent convicts to the war. They threw everything against us, similar to the other tyranny, which is in the Battle of the Bulge. Threw everything it had against the free world, just like the brave American soldiers which held their lines and fought back Hitler’s forces during the Christmas of 1944. Brave Ukrainian soldiers are doing the same to Putin’s forces this Christmas. Ukraine — Ukraine holds its lines and will never surrender. So, so, here the front line, the tyranny which has no lack of cruelty against the lives of free people — and your support is crucial, not just to stand in such fight but to get to the turning point to win on the battlefield. We have artillery, yes. Thank you. We have it. Is it enough? Honestly, not really. To ensure Bakhmut is not just a stronghold that holds back the Russian Army, but for the Russian Army to completely pull out, more cannons and shells are needed. If so, just like the Battle of Saratoga, the fight for Bakhmut will change the trajectory of our war for independence and for freedom. If your Patriots stop the Russian terror against our cities, it will let Ukrainian patriots work to the full to defend our freedom. When Russia — when Russia cannot reach our cities by its artillery, it tries to destroy them with missile attacks. More than that, Russia found an ally in this — in this genocidal policy: Iran. Iranian deadly drones sent to Russia in hundreds — in hundreds became a threat to our critical infrastructure. That is how one terrorist has found the other. It is just a matter of time when they will strike against your other allies if we do not stop them now. We must do it. I believe there should be no taboos between us in our alliance. Ukraine never asked the American soldiers to fight on our land instead of us. I assure you that Ukrainian soldiers can perfectly operate American tanks and planes themselves. Financial assistance is also critically important, and I would like to thank you, thank you very much, thank you for both financial packages you have already provided us with and the ones you may be willing to decide on. Your money is not charity. It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way. Russia, Russia could stop its aggression, really, if it wanted to, but you can speed up our victory. I know it. And it, it will prove to any potential aggressor that no one can succeed in breaking national borders, no one committing atrocities and reigning over people against their will. It would be naïve to wait for steps towards peace from Russia, which enjoys being a terrorist state. Russians are still poisoned by the Kremlin. The restoration of international legal order is our joint task. We need peace, yes. Ukraine has already offered proposals, which I just discussed with President Biden, our peace formula, 10 points which should and must be implemented for our joint security, guaranteed for decades ahead and the summit which can be held. I’m glad to say that President Biden supported our peace initiative today. Each of you, ladies and gentlemen, can assist in the implementation to ensure that America’s leadership remains solid, bicameral and bipartisan. Thank you. You can strengthen sanctions to make Russia feel how ruinous its aggression truly is. It is in your power, really, to help us bring to justice everyone who started this unprovoked and criminal war. Let’s do it. Let terrorist — let the terrorist state be held responsible for its terror and aggression and compensate all losses done by this war. Let the world see that the United States are here. Ladies and gentlemen — ladies and gentlemen, Americans, in two days we will celebrate Christmas. Maybe candlelit. Not because it’s more romantic, no, but because there will not be, there will be no electricity. Millions won’t have neither heating nor running water. All of these will be the result of Russian missile and drone attacks on our energy infrastructure. But we do not complain. We do not judge and compare whose life is easier. Your well-being is the product of your national security; the result of your struggle for independence and your many victories. We, Ukrainians, will also go through our war of independence and freedom with dignity and success. We’ll celebrate Christmas. Celebrate Christmas and, even if there is no electricity, the light of our faith in ourselves will not be put out. If Russian — if Russian missiles attack us, we’ll do our best to protect ourselves. If they attack us with Iranian drones and our people will have to go to bomb shelters on Christmas Eve, Ukrainians will still sit down at the holiday table and cheer up each other. And we don’t, don’t have to know everyone’s wish, as we know that all of us, millions of Ukrainians, wish the same: Victory. Only victory. We already built strong Ukraine, with strong people, strong army, strong institutions together with you. We developed strong security guarantees for our country and for entire Europe and the world, together with you. And also together with you, we’ll put in place everyone who will defy freedom.This will be the basis to protect democracy in Europe and the world over. Now, on this special Christmastime, I want to thank you, all of you. I thank every American family which cherishes the warmth of its home and wishes the same warmth to other people. I thank President Biden and both parties, at the Senate and the House, for your invaluable assistance. I thank your cities and your citizens who supported Ukraine this year, who hosted our Ukrainians, our people, who waved our national flags, who acted to help us. Thank you all, from everyone who is now at the front line, from everyone who is awaiting victory. Standing here today, I recall the words of the president Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which are I think so good for this moment. “The American people, in their righteous might, will win through to absolute victory.” The Ukrainian people will win, too, absolutely. I know that everything depends on us, on Ukrainian armed forces, yet so much depends on the world. So much in the world depends on you. When I was in Bakhmut yesterday, our heroes gave me the flag, the battle flag, the flag of those who defend Ukraine, Europe and the world at the cost of their lives. They asked me to bring this flag to you, to the U.S. Congress, to members of the House of Representatives and senators whose decisions can save millions of people. So, let these decisions be taken. Let this flag stay with you, ladies and gentlemen. This flag is a symbol of our victory in this war. We stand, we fight and we will win because we are united — Ukraine, America and the entire free world. Just one thing, if I can, the last thing — thank you so much, may God protect our brave troops and citizens, may God forever bless the United States of America. Merry Christmas and a happy, victorious New Year. Glory to Ukraine.",212,222,0,Democrat,50,48,2,Democrat,117
Olena Zelenska,Ukraine,369,7,2022,First Lady,"Good morning. Dear members of the Congress, ladies and gentlemen. I am grateful for the opportunity to be here and to address the Congress of the United States of America. I know this is the first time when the wife of the president of a foreign country has the honor to address you within these walls. This is really important to me and for my country. And today I want to address you as politicians and party representatives as well as mothers and fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers, daughters and sons. I want to address you, not as first lady, but as a daughter and as a mother. No matter what positions and titles we reach in our lives, first of all, we always remain part of our family. We always remain children to our parents. And no matter how old we are, they love us as their children. And we are always parents to our children. And no matter what happens to them, they will always remain our children. This is the great truth of our life. Our family represents the whole world for us. And we do everything to preserve it. And we are happy when we succeed in it. And we cry when we cannot save it. And we remain completely broken when our world is destroyed by war. Tens of thousands of our world have been destroyed in Ukraine. I am waiting for a picture to be demonstrated. This is Lisa. I met this girl before Christmas when we were preparing greetings of Christmas, Merry Christmas for children. I remember her just like she is here. A cheerful, playful little rascal. The other video was made by Lisa’s mother, whose name is Irena, when she took her child to school. And she asked her, where are we going, sweetie? The daughter calls the name of her favorite teacher. Lisa was only 4 years old. She’s no longer with us. Here is a stroller of Lisa’s. On July 14, Lisa was killed by a Russian missile attack on our city of Vinnytsia in the center of Ukraine. 25 people were killed. Almost 200 injured. Lisa’s mother is in serious condition. For several days, nobody dared to tell her that Lisa had died. This is our world. Where are we going? Ringing in my ears for six days. Usually the wives of president are exclusively engaged in peaceful affairs, education, human rights, equality, accessibility. And maybe you expected for me to speak on this topics. But how can I talk about them when an unprovoked invasive terrorist war is being waged against my country? Russia is destroying our people. Here is another rocket missile. This girl is Eva. She liked to draw pictures. She was only 5. Another Russian missile. Eva was killed along with her grandmother. These young faces are the faces of employees and visitors of the shopping mall. They are no more. There is no shopping mall because Russia because Russia burned them down and killed them all. There is a journalist Vera. She worked in the Ukraine area for 20 years. Last four years working for radio. Since the beginning of the war Russia has launched over 3,000 different missiles to Ukraine. You don’t need a missile. Maybe shrapnel will do it. This man is now alive in Germany. He’s 3 years old. A few days ago, he celebrated his birthday on the eighth of July. You may ask, what is he doing in Germany? He is learning there how to use a prosthesis. A 3-year-old boy. A Russian plane dropped a bomb on the house where the family of Andriy spent the night. He was there together with his parents and his sister, Anya. How many children like him are there in Ukraine? How many families like this may still be destroyed by the war? Those are Russia’s Hunger Games, hunting for peaceful people in peaceful cities of Ukraine. They will not broadcast this on their news. That’s why I’m showing it to you here. Here is the family of a policeman. His father, mother, wife, 6-year-old daughter, as well as is 1 ½-month-old son, all of them were shot by the Russian occupiers in the car when they were trying to evacuate from Nova Kahovka. Then I met with Ole H. He told me a terrible story. The adults died right away while children for the next 1 ½ hours were crying in the car until they died. Nobody was able – allowed to approach them to save them. Here is Sofia, a girl from Bucha, who lost her mother during the occupation and her arm and now she’s suffering from phantom pains. The family of Olga Suhkenka, she was the village head and saved her fellow villagers from the Russian invaders until they left and she was killed along with her son and husband. A family from Odessa, three generation of women were killed by one missile. Valeria Holden, her mother, and 3-month-old daughter. And a 96-year-old. Borys Romanchenko. Can you imagine this person survived four Nazi concentration camps an died in Kharkiv from Russian shells? So ladies and gentlemen, the American people and American families, the Congress and President Biden have already done a lot to help us stand up to the enemy and protect Ukrainians. We are grateful, really grateful that the United States stands with us in this fight for our shared values of human life and independence. You helped us and your help is very strong. While Russia kills, America saves. And you should know about it. We thank you for that. But unfortunately, the war is not over. The terror continues. And I appeal to all of you on behalf of those who were killed, on behalf of those people who lost their arms and legs, on behalf of those who are still alive and well, those who wait for their families to come back from the front, still alive and well, those who wait for their families to come back from the front, I’m asking for something now that I would never want to. I am asking for weapons. Weapons that would not be used to wage a war on somebody else’s land but to protect one’s home and the right to wake up alive in that home. I’m asking for rockets not to kill children in their strollers. In order for rockets not to destroy children’s rooms and kill entire families. I know that you, ladies and gentlemen, will be leaving for the traditional Congressional recess in a week. And all of you will be able to return to your offices in the fall and probably all of you have already your calendar and schedule for September. It’s normal. It’s this normalcy that us Ukrainians are deprived of. Will my son be able to return to school in the fall? I don’t know. Like millions of families in Ukraine. Will my daughter will be able to go to university at the beginning of the academic year and experience normal student life? I cannot answer. What should the Ukrainian teachers prepare for, to work in classrooms or bomb shelters? We will have answers if we had air defense systems. In fact, the answer is right here in Washington, D.C. America, unfortunately knows from its own experience what terrorist attacks are and has already sought to defeat terrorists. Help us to stop this terror against Ukrainians, and this will be our joy, great victory in the name of life, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness of every person, every family. This is what I’m asking for and what my husband is asking for. Not as a presidential couple, but as parents and children of their parents. Because we want everybody and every mother to tell their child, go to sleep peacefully. There will be no more air strikes, no more missile strikes. Is this too much to wish for? The fact that I am here as the first lady of my country and have this opportunity to talk to you about weapons is the manifestation of the greatest equality. This is equality among free people. People who know what they are protecting. They know what they live for. I hope you heard me today, and I hope that your decisions will be speedy. Thank you for your attention. Glory to Ukraine.",212,222,0,Democrat,50,48,2,Democrat,117
Kyriakos Mitsotakis,Hellenic Republic (Greece),350,5,2022,Prime Minister,"Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, Honorable Members of the United States Congress, Ladies and Gentlemen,There is no greater honor for the elected leader of the people who created democracy than to address the elected representatives of the people who founded their country on the Greek model and have promoted and defended democratic values ever since. I am conscious as I stand before you today of the deep ties that bind our two nations together. They are a reason for celebration and thanks but they are also a reminder, I believe, of our shared values and beliefs at a time when these are once again being tested. Our shared belief in freedom over tyranny, in democracy over authoritarianism, in the fundamental importance of respect for the rule of law over war and anarchy. It is an added honor, and a great pleasure, for me to address a joint session of the US Congress under female leadership, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and, of course, Vice President Kamala Harris. For it was a Greek, and a Greek man at that, who first advocated equal rights for women. In “The Republic” Plato proposed that women should share all levels of power and take on all challenges, including military service. Any state that does not employ the talents of its women, Plato made clear, is wasting half of its resources. And as the son, husband, sibling and father of strong, creative women, I couldn’t agree more. Like all Greeks, every time I come to Washington I feel as if I’m coming home, because everything I see around me, the architecture, the art, the ideas carved into marble throughout the city, is so familiar. Walking into the Lincoln Memorial is like walking into the Parthenon when it was still intact, before Lord Elgin’s art collecting hobby defaced it, because it was modeled on the earlier monument. Driving by the Supreme Court and seeing above the entrance its motto and mission, “Equal Justice Under Law,” we remember that it is a concept that our Greek ancestors first conceived and articulated in a single word, “Isonomia.” Of course, it was not only Washington’s buildings and culture that were immeasurably influenced by Greece but also the city’s main business, democratic politics, were founded in Athens as well. In fact, to be brutally frank, we all owe our jobs to our noble ancestors.But I come here not to seek appreciation from you or praise for them. I come before you to celebrate a miracle that all free peoples cherish but that binds Greeks and Americans in a unique way. That miracle, the Greek idea that would forever change the world, is that society functions best if all of its citizens are equal and have the right to share in running their state. In a word, democracy. It is hard for us today to realize how radical the idea of individual freedom was 25 centuries ago when a small community of Greeks dared to entrust equal political and legal rights to all its citizens. Women and slaves were excluded, but it was still such an extraordinary departure from what had gone before that it remains the most profound leap of faith in human history. No society before the Greeks dared to believe that order and freedom were compatible. All societies before them were a succession of tyrannies that relied on a strong ruler, a king, a pharaoh, an emperor, to keep them functioning. The lesson was not lost on the founders of the United States who shaped the American Constitution on the Athenian model but they were wise enough to insert checks and balances to avoid the excesses that eventually undermined Athenian democracy. The birth of democracy in ancient Athens brought about an explosion of the creative spirit in Greece that produced the architecture, the art, the drama and the philosophy that have shaped western civilization ever since. The establishment of democracy in the United States has brought about the greatest expansion of human freedom and human progress the world has ever known. Ladies and gentlemen, Last year Greece celebrated 200 years since the beginning of our war of independence. And in a very strange but interesting twist of historical fate, it was the Greek people who were inspired by the foundation of American democracy when they rose against their oppressor to fight for their own freedom. What Americans had shown us by their example was that liberty can be fought for and, even when against the odds, won. We understood the founding of your republic to be a watershed in the history of the world, a model for the oppressed nations of Europe, a hope for our own future. Right from the start, therefore, our forefathers looked across the Atlantic for support. From the distant Peloponnese, the leaders of the Greek revolution sent an appeal in the spring of 1821 to the American people, their ‘friends, fellow-citizens and brethren’. They spoke of the ‘natural sympathy’ the Greeks felt for Americans, the thirst for freedom that they had both derived from the ancients. ‘In imitating you,’ they wrote, ‘we imitate our own ancestors. We shall show ourselves worthy of them in proportion as we resemble you.’ The founding fathers of your Republic were moved and impressed. ‘Light and liberty are in steady advance,’ wrote Thomas Jefferson on learning of the news from Greece. ‘The flames kindled on 4th July 1776 have spread over too much of the globe to be extinguished by the feeble engines of despotism.’ Exactly 200 years ago, in 1822, revolutionary Greeks assembled at Epidavros, debated and drew up our first Constitution. And with this document they introduced into the newly liberated Greek lands the new language of rights. Above all of the right of a nation to throw off the shackles of tyranny in order to live under the rule of law. In the words of our Declaration of Independence: Have we something lesser than other nations, that we remain deprived of these rights, or are we of a nature lower or less civilized, that we should view ourselves as unworthy to enjoy them and instead be condemned to an eternal slavery, subjected, like automata or beasts of burden, to the absurd caprices of a cruel tyrant. These are rights which within Greece we have never ceased to defend by arms when times and circumstances have permitted.” A shocking reality: Replace the word Greece with Ukraine and the similarities to today’s turbulent world are harrowing. Two years later, in a little town in Western Greece called Mesolonghi, these words were published alongside a translation of the American Constitution. That book, one of the first ever printed on Greek soil, stands testimony to the immense value we Greeks attached from the start to our own future as a liberal and constitutional polity. That this little book appeared at the height of the war was remarkable. That it was printed in Mesolonghi was simply incredible. Like Mariupol today, Mesolonghi’s outnumbered and emaciated defenders would repeatedly repel wave upon wave of enemy attacks before their final desperate sortie, an act of extraordinary daring. But one that would ultimately cost hundreds of lives, many of whom were women and children. When we see the same suffering among the outnumbered defenders of Mariupol, a city with a Greek name and deep Greek roots, we are reminded of Mesolonghi and the costs of our own struggle. Even today we have not forgotten the American volunteers who sailed to fight alongside us. Some of them gave their lives for our freedom. Their names are honored and their graves are still cared for. Nor have we forgotten others of your countrymen who mounted one of the first public humanitarian efforts in history by sending Greece aid and assistance. Remarkable figures like Samuel Gridley Howe cared for women and children who had been left homeless and destitute, and established hospitals, schools and orphanages that supported us in the difficult years that followed. The first school for girls in Greece was founded in Athens in 1831, by an American pastor, John Hill. The Hill Memorial School still continues to teach Greek children today in the historic center of Athens. This long arc of American philanthropy continued through the nineteenth century, spreading across the Near and Middle East. And in times of dire need in the following decades, most notably a century ago, when hundreds of thousands of refugees streamed into Greece from Asia Minor in the catastrophic aftermath of the First World War, American institutions were there to bring aid and relief. And, of course it was the Marshal plan that helped my country rebuild its infrastructure after the devastating Second World War and the civil war that ensued. And in its own way, Greece reciprocated. Among the Greek orphans who were brought across the Atlantic into the United States to escape the fighting after 1821 were a future congressman and a commander in the US navy. Young Greeks saved from the war became American educators and writers. Many of them were dedicated abolitionists, for the eradication of slavery was a cause whose urgent necessity spoke directly to men and women who had once been enslaved themselves. Over the past two centuries our two countries have always been on the right side of history. We fought side by side in world wars to defend freedom and democracy. Our democracies have struggled with internal demons. We endured the horrific pains of civil wars and the desperation of economic crises. But we have emerged stronger and more committed to defend the values that our ancestors gave their lives for. Esteemed members of Congress, I began today by saying that this bicentennial is more than a moment of celebration. It is also a reminder of the values that bind us together and the tasks we still face. The world has changed a good deal in the recent months. But the warning signs have been with us for decades. Following the end of the Cold War we naively believed that Europe, which had twice driven the world into global conflict, had finally found the path to peace. We believed that international cooperation and a shared commitment to the rule of law now prevailed over guns and armies. We believed that the deepening of the European Union, a unique experiment designed to further link our countries together, would make war on the «Dark Continent» unthinkable. We believed that given the tragic and harrowing experiences of the twentieth century, no one would venture to suppress another people’s right to exist or alter its borders by force. We naively ignored the warning signs flashing red. And we even ignored Russia’s actions in Syria and its annexation of Crimea. We know now that we were wrong. Today, like all of you, we Greeks look at what is happening just five hundred miles to our north, and we are horrified and appalled. We look to Kyiv and to Odessa, the city where our revolution was first conceived, and we look to the tragedy unfolding in eastern Ukraine. We see Mariupol, a Greek city founded by Catherine the Great in 1778 to resettle Greeks from Crimea fleeing Ottoman rule. And what we see once again is a people who are faced with the necessity of fighting to defend themselves in order to secure their future. Let me be clear: we have no animus towards the Russian people, with whom we have been bound so closely by faith and history. But we cannot be indifferent to a struggle that reminds us so much of our own. We too know what it is to be forced to reckon with invasion, to stand up for one’s beliefs and to have to resort to arms to protect our liberty. We too know about the heroism of the underdog, for whom the first victory comes from not capitulating in the face of overwhelming odds. From simply hanging on and praying that others will come to our aid. And we understand too the importance of friends, and the power of allies, in the defense of the values that we share. Without allies the Greeks would not, for all their heroism, have been able to win their independence. And that is why we recognize the importance of taking sides now. And we took sides. Unequivocally. We stand by Ukraine against Putin’s aggression. We delivered humanitarian aid. We supported the Ukrainians with weapons to help them defend their homeland. And we have welcomed, with open arms, refugees who have fled their homeland in search of safety for themselves and their families. Mr. Putin is striving to create a world in which power is for the strong state but not the small. A world in which territorial claims are made on the basis of historical fantasies and enforced by aggression, rather than decided by peace treaties. A world in which armies rather than diplomats settle disputes. He will not succeed. He must not succeed. He must not succeed, not only for the sake of Ukraine but also in order to send a message to all authoritarian leaders that historical revisionism and open acts of aggression that violate international law will not be tolerated by the global community of democratic states. The language of resentment, revisionism and imperial nostalgia shall not prevail. And speaking of open acts of aggression, I ask you, esteemed members of Congress, not to forget an open wound that has caused Hellenism unending pain over the past 48 years. I am referring to the invasion and subsequent division of Cyprus. This issue has to be resolved in accordance with international law and in line with the relevant decisions of the United Nations Security Council. As I told President Biden yesterday, nobody can and nobody will accept a two- state solution in Cyprus. The same is true for all other regional disputes. Greece is a peace seeking democracy that always extends a hand of friendship to our neighbors. We are always open to dialogue. But there is only one framework we can use to resolve our differences: international law and the unwritten principles of good neighborly relations. I want to be absolutely clear. We will not accept open acts of aggression that violate our sovereignty and our territorial rights. These include overflights over Greek islands, which must stop immediately. Please also note: the last thing that NATO needs at a time when our focus is on helping Ukraine defeat Russia’s aggression is another source of instability on NATO’s Southeastern flank. And I ask you take this into account when you make defense procurement decisions concerning the Eastern Mediterranean. The United States has, I believe, vital interests in this part of the world. It is very important that you remain engaged and work with partners with whom you share not only common strategic priorities, but also shared values and a shared history. Ladies and gentlemen, Last Thursday the Hellenic parliament ratified the new Mutual Defense and Cooperation Agreement between our two countries. Whereas previously it was renewed annually by an act of Parliament, it now has a five-year duration, after which it is automatically renewed, unless one of the parties chooses not to do so. This Αgreement is a powerful testament of our enduring strategic partnership and our commitment to maintain peace and promote prosperity in the Eastern Mediterranean. Nowhere is that more obvious than in Souda Bay, which I know many of you have visited. The largest naval base in the Eastern Mediterranean, and the only port that can accommodate aircraft carriers. But it is also obvious in the city of Alexandroupolis, in Northeastern Greece, which is rapidly becoming an energy hub for the entire region. This is important, as we seek to rapidly diversify away from Russian gas, investing in the necessary infrastructure that will make it possible to import large quantities and liquefied natural gas, this becomes critical. Not just for Greece but also for our Balkan neighbors. I should tell my colleagues I don’t get so much applause in the Greek Parliament. And we will interconnect the Greek electricity grids with Cyprus, Israel and Egypt in order to import cheap renewable energy from the Middle East and Africa into the European electricity system. But the thriving partnership of our two countries is not just limited to security and energy. Pfizer has set up a big data analytics center in Thessaloniki. Microsoft is building state of the art data centers on the outskirts of Athens. JP Morgan has invested in one of our leading Greek fintech companies. What American companies see in Greece is not just a country endowed with an advantageous geographical position, and blessed with natural beauty that makes it a magnet for visitors from all over the world. They also see a dynamic economy that has overcome the difficulties, the pathogenies of the past and is supporting entrepreneurship and private investment. And a workforce of young, talented, well-educated Greeks who, after a decade of crisis, choose to remain in their homeland rather than emigrating. Or for those who have actually left the country, choose to return to Greece now. And, I am convinced they will be the protagonists of Greece’s bright future. Esteemed members of Congress, I have spoken about the joint paths that our two great democracies have chartered over the past two centuries. We have every reason today to celebrate our achievements. But it would be fullish to remain complacent. The United States has a crucial role to play today in our even more complicated world. From addressing climate change to standing up against authoritarian regimes, from countering fake news and disinformation to preparing for the next pandemic, the world looks to the strongest and most prosperous democracy for leadership. You simply cannot afford to sit on the sidelines. Multilateralism, in my mind, is not an option but a necessity. Not only for a more stable world order but also for your own self-interest. But we also need to put our own house in order. Personally, I am more worried about the internal fragmentations of our democracies than I fear the threat of arrogant despots. We frequently remember the words of President Ronald Reagan “Freedom is never more than a generation away from extinction”. But let us not forget that Abraham Lincoln referred to the “unfinished business of democracy”. And unfinished it is indeed. Our democracies are threatened by the sirens of populists who offer easy solutions to complicated problems. Their voices are being heard, primarily because income inequality has increased in our societies and many, justifiably, feel that they are left behind. In Greece we speak from experience. We paid a heavy price for listening to them. Everywhere in the world, in the United States, in Greece, in Europe, social media is polarizing public debate and transforming the public sphere into a modern-day version of the tower of Babel, where we speak different languages and we only listen to those who share the same views with us. There are three major forces that collectively bind together successful democracies. Social capital, by that I mean extensive social networks, with high levels of trust, so admired by Alexis de Tocqueville. Strong institutions. And common stories that forge a unified national identity. All three are being eroded. And at the same time authoritarian regimes are questioning our ability to deliver prosperity for all our citizens. They are offering their people a Faustian deal: trade political freedom and individual rights for high levels of growth and individual economic wellbeing. Many are willing to accept it. These are some of the challenges we face today. That is why making our democracies more resilient is such an important priority for our generation. I wish I had the answers to these complicated questions. But I know where to start. We need to strengthen our democratic institutions to address the root causes of our citizens’ anger and distrust. We need to tackle income inequalities without losing the dynamism of our open economies. We need to reform social media so that it becomes less socially corrosive. And we need to train our young people to seize the opportunities of democratic citizenship in this new age. And maybe a dive into our shared historical past would be of particular use. James Madison knew that democracies can be threatened by the “turbulency and weakness of unruly passions”. That is why insulating decision making from the emotion of the moment, while still holding democratic leaders accountable on election day was one of his major preoccupations. Madison was clearly inspired by Pericles, who knew that democracy had a dark side that, if left unrestrained, could lead to its downfall. Thucydides had Pericles say of Ancient Athens: “We are a free democracy but we obey our laws, more especially those who protect the weak, and the unwritten laws whose transgression bring shame”. Every time we gaze in wonder at the Parthenon frieze, half of which unfortunately still sits in the British Museum rather than the Acropolis Museum where it belongs, we are reminded of the glory of a thriving democracy. 30 years after the Parthenon was constructed, democracy in Athens was no more. Reinventing democracy to fit the challenges of the 21st century may sound like a tall order. But this is the mission of our generation and I am certain we will accomplish it. Esteemed members of Congress, Let me conclude by making a special reference to the one unshakable bond that will always bind our countries together. The Greek American community. It is a special moment to see so many of you here with us today. Over the past 120 years you have warmly welcomed, encouraged and supported the waves of immigrants who came to your country in search of a better life. Not to mention the students like me who spent seven years studying in American universities. Those who sailed to this country were not philosophers and poets like their noble ancestors. For the most part, they were simple laborers, and they eagerly took any work they could find. But no matter how uneducated the Greeks or how menial their work, they would typically apply themselves with great determination and embrace any chance to prosper in life and educate their children. They offered them a brighter future, fulfilling the solemn duty that every generation should be able to live a better life than the previous one. They experienced the American dream, but never forgot where they came from. Today the Greeks who live in the US and the three million Americans who identify themselves as Greeks include some of the most respected leaders in the arts, science, education, medicine, the judiciary, and, of course, politics. Modern visionaries like Nikolas Negroponte and Albert Bourla. John Kassavetis and Elia Kazan. Jeffrey Evgenidis and George Pelekanos. Alexander Payne and Tom Hanks. And of course, Yannis Antetokounmpo. Six of them are in this Congress and one of them, my friend Mike Dukakis, ran for president of the United States. I think one of the reasons Greeks were accepted in America so readily is the fact that the values of America are Greek values. On of the qualities that Greeks value the most is called “Sophrosene,” a word best translated as self-control, temperance, and harmony. The ancient Greeks thought arrogance, extremism, and excess the worst threats to democracy. “For man,” Aristotle wrote, “life according to reason is best and most pleasant, since reason more than anything else is man.” That reason tells me we Greeks and Americans have a lot more to contribute as custodians of democracy. That government of the people, by the people, for the people shall thrive again. I bring you here today the pledge of the Greek people that we stand together with the people of the United States whenever and wherever necessary to ensure that the hope our ancestors bequeathed to the world 25 cαenturies ago will endure, and the dream of freedom for every human being on this planet will never die. Long live the friendship between Greece and the United States of America!",212,222,0,Democrat,50,48,2,Democrat,117
Volodymyr Zelenskyy,Ukraine,369,3,2022,President ,"Mrs. Speaker, Members of Congress, Ladies and Gentlemen, Americans! Friends! I am proud to greet you from Ukraine, from our capital - Kyiv. From a city that is under missile and air strikes by Russian troops. Daily. But it does not give up. And it didn't even think to give up for a single minute! Just as dozens of other cities and communities in our country, which found themselves in the worst war since World War II. I have the honor to greet you on behalf of the Ukrainian people, brave and freedom-loving people. For eight years they have been resisting the aggression of the Russian Federation. They sacrifice the best children - sons and daughters to stop the full-scale Russian invasion. Now the fate of our state is being decided. The fate of our people. It is being decided whether Ukrainians will be free. Whether they will preserve their democracy. Russia has attacked more than just our land and our cities. It went on a brutal offensive against our values. Basic human values. It threw tanks and planes against our freedom. Against our right to live freely in our country, choosing our own future. Against our desire for happiness. Against our national dreams. Just like yours, ordinary people of America. Just like those of everyone in the United States. I remember your Rushmore National Memorial. The faces of your prominent presidents. Those who laid the foundations of America. As it is today. Democracy, independence, freedom and care for everyone. Everyone who works diligently. Who lives honestly. Who respects the law. We in Ukraine want the same for ourselves. All that is a normal part of life for you. Ladies and Gentlemen! Americans! In your great history you have pages that will allow you to understand Ukrainians. Understand us now. When it is needed most. Remember Pearl Harbor. Terrible morning of December 7, 1941. When your sky was black from the planes attacking you. Just remember that. Remember September 11th. A terrible day in 2001, when evil tried to turn your cities into a battlefield. When innocent people were attacked. Attacked from the air. In a way no one expected. In a way you could not stop it. Our state experiences this every day! Every night! For three weeks now! Different Ukrainian cities... Odesa and Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy, Zhytomyr and Lviv, Mariupol and Dnipro. Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death. For thousands of people. Russian troops have already fired nearly a thousand missiles at Ukraine. Countless bombs. They use drones to kill more precisely. This is a terror Europe has not seen for 80 years! And we ask for a response. For the response from the world. For the response to terror. Is this too much of a request? To establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine is to save people. Humanitarian no-fly zone. Conditions under which Russia will no longer be able to terrorize our peaceful cities every day and night. If that's too much, we offer an alternative. You know what defense systems we need. C-300 and other similar systems. You know how much depends on the battlefield on the ability to use aircraft. Powerful, strong aircraft. To protect your people. Your freedom. Your land. Aircraft that can help Ukraine. That can help Europe. And you also know that they are available. But on land. Not in the Ukrainian sky. They do not protect our people. ""I have a dream"" - these words are known to each of you. Today I can say: I have a necessity. The necessity to protect our sky. The necessity for your decision. Your help. And it will mean exactly the same thing. The same thing you feel. When you hear: I have a dream. Ladies and Gentlemen! Friends! Ukraine is grateful to the United States for its overwhelming support. For all that your state and your people have already done for our freedom. For weapons and ammunition, for training and funding, for leadership in the free world, which helps put pressure on the aggressor economically. I am grateful to President Biden for his personal involvement, for his sincere commitment to the defense of Ukraine and democracy around the world. I am grateful to you for the resolution, which recognizes all those who commit crimes against the Ukrainian people as war criminals. However, now, in the darkest time for our country, for the whole of Europe, I urge you to do more! New packages of sanctions are needed every week. Until the Russian military machine stops. Restrictions are needed as regards everyone on whom this unjust regime is based. We offer the United States to impose sanctions against all politicians in the Russian Federation who remain in office and do not sever ties with those responsible for the aggression against Ukraine. From State Duma deputies to the last official who lacks the morale to sever ties with state terror. All American companies must leave Russia, their market. Leave this market flooded with our blood. Ladies and Gentlemen. Members of Congress! Take the lead! If you have companies in the constituencies that sponsor the Russian military machine, keeping their business in Russia... You have to put pressure. So that the Russian state does not receive a single dollar, which it spends on the destruction of Ukraine. On the destruction of Europe. All American ports must be closed to Russian goods and ships. Peace is more important than profit. And we must defend this principle throughout the world together. We have already become part of the anti-war coalition. The great anti-war coalition, which unites many states, dozens of states. Those who reacted in a principled manner to President Putin's decision - to Russia's invasion of our state. But we have to move on. We have to create new tools. To respond quickly! And stop the war. The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine began on February 24. And it would be fair if it ended in a day. In 24 hours. So that evil is punished immediately. Today the world does not have such tools. The wars of the past have prompted our predecessors to create institutions that were supposed to protect us from war. But... They don't work. We see it. You see it. So, we need new ones. New institutions. New alliances. And we offer them. We offer to create an association - U-24. United for peace. A union of responsible states that have the strength and conscience to stop conflicts. Immediately. Provide all necessary assistance in 24 hours. If necessary - weapons. If necessary - sanctions. Humanitarian support. Political support. Funding. Everything necessary to preserve peace quickly. To save lives. In addition, such an association could provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters, man-made disasters. Who fell victim to a humanitarian crisis or epidemic. Remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest thing - to give everyone vaccines. Vaccines against Covid. To save lives. To prevent new strains. The world spent months and years doing things that could have been done much faster. So that there were no human losses. Ladies and Gentlemen! Americans! If such an alliance, the U-24, had already been formed, I believe it would have saved thousands of lives. In our country, many other countries that need peace so crucially, that suffered inhuman destruction... I ask you to watch one video now. Video of what Russian troops did on our land. We have to stop this. We must prevent such things. Preventively destroy every aggressor who seeks to conquer another nation. Please watch... And in the end to sum it up. Today it is not enough to be the leader of the nation. Today it takes to be the Leader of the world. Being the Leader of the world means to be the Leader of Peace. Peace in your country does not depend anymore only on you and your people. It depends on those next to you, on those who are strong. Strong does not mean big. Strong is brave and ready to fight for the life of his citizens and citizens of the world. For human rights, for freedom, for the right to live decently and to die when your time comes, not when it is wanted by someone else, by your neighbor. Today the Ukrainian people are defending not only Ukraine, we are fighting for the values of Europe and the world, sacrificing our lives in the name of the Future. That’s why today the American people are helping not just Ukraine, but Europe and the world to keep the planet alive, to keep justice in history. Now I am almost 45 years old. Today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating. I see no sense in life if it cannot stop death. And this is my main mission as the Leader of my people – great Ukrainians. And as the Leader of my nation I am addressing President Biden. You are the Leader of the nation, of your great nation. I wish you to be the Leader of the world. Being the Leader of the world means to be the Leader of Peace. Thank you. Glory to Ukraine!",212,222,0,Democrat,50,48,2,Democrat,117
Jens Stoltenberg,Kingdom of Norway,385,4,2019,Secretary General of NATO,"Madam Speaker, Mr Vice President, Honourable members of the United States Congress, Ladies and gentlemen. I am really truly honoured and grateful for the privilege of addressing you all today. And to represent the 29 members of the NATO Alliance. 70 years ago, tomorrow, NATO’s founding treaty was signed in this great city. On that day, President Truman said, “We hope to create a shield against aggression and the fear of aggression; a bulwark which will permit us to get on with the real business of government and society; the business of achieving a fuller and happier life for all our citizens.” Our Alliance was created by people who had lived through two devastating world wars. They knew only too well the horror, the suffering, and the human and material cost of war. They were determined that this should never happen again. And they were also determined to stand up to the expansion of the Soviet Union. Which was taking control of its neighbours. Crushing democracies. And oppressing their people. So, they founded NATO. With a clear purpose. To preserve peace and to safeguard freedom. With an iron-clad commitment by all members of the Alliance to protect each other. They made a solemn promise. One for all and all for one. This commitment has served us well. Peace has been preserved. Freedom maintained. Yes, Allies have been involved in conflicts in different parts of the world. And Allies have suffered the pain of terrorist attacks. But no NATO Ally has been attacked by another country. The Cold War ended without a shot being fired in Europe. And we have experienced an unprecedented period of peace. So, the NATO alliance is not only the longest lasting alliance in history. It is the most successful alliance in history. Ever since the founding of our Alliance in 1949, every Congress, every American president, your men and women in uniform, and the people of the United States of America, have been staunch supporters of NATO. America has been the backbone of our Alliance. It has been fundamental to European security and for our freedom. We would not have the peaceful and prosperous Europe we see today without the sacrifice and commitment of the United States. For your enduring support, I thank you all today. So NATO has been good for Europe. And NATO has been good for the United States. The strength of a nation is not only measured by the size of its economy. Or the number of its soldiers. But also by the number of its friends. And through NATO, the United States has more friends and allies than any other power. This has made the United States stronger, safer, and more secure. Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice-President, It’s good to have friends. Yesterday as I flew over the Atlantic, I looked out of my window at the ocean below. The great ocean that lies between our two continents. The Atlantic does not divide us. It unites us. It binds us together. And for Norwegians like me, the Atlantic Ocean defines who we are. Indeed, it was a Norseman, Leif Eriksen, who was the first European to reach American shores, almost a thousand years ago. A fact that more people would know… if he had not left so quickly! And decided not to tell anyone about it! For adventurers like Leif Eriksen, the Atlantic Ocean was never a barrier. Rather, it was a great blue bridge to new lands and new possibilities. For millions of Europeans, it has been a bridge to freedom, sanctuary, and hope. My grandparents were among them. My mother was born in Patterson, New Jersey. And I lived part of my childhood in San Francisco. This has given me a deep sense of kinship with this wonderful country. A kinship that has only grown throughout my life. I remember well, during the Cold War, when I was a young conscript in the Norwegian army. Our forces were trained and equipped to hold the line. And Norway is actually bordering the Soviet Union in the Cold War. We knew that we could not take on the might of the Soviet Union alone. But we also knew that we were not alone. We knew that, if needed, our NATO Allies, led by the United States, would soon be there with us. We enjoyed a level of security that only our transatlantic Alliance could provide. So, thanks to NATO, as a young man during the Cold War I felt safe. And that says something about the strength of our Alliance. Madam Speaker, Mr Vice President, Members of Congress, At the entrance to the NATO headquarters in Belgium, there are two monuments. One, a piece of the Berlin Wall. Designed to keep people in and ideas out. It failed. It failed because the ideas and the values of those who built it were less compelling and less powerful than ours. Because we, as NATO, were resolute. We stood together and would not back down. The other monument is a twisted steel beam from the North Tower of the World Trade Centre. A memorial to the ordinary people going about their business on an ordinary day when the unthinkable happened. A memorial to the 2,977 people who lost their lives on 9/11. A reminder of how all NATO Allies stood with the United States in its hour of need. One monument is a symbol of freedom. The other a symbol of solidarity. Both are symbols of NATO. Who we are and what we stand for. What so many of our brave men and women have fought and sometimes died for. But not in vain. And not alone. The men and women of our armed forces have served together over the decades. This includes actually also many of you in this room, in this Congress, and in my delegation. I pay tribute to you and to all those who serve in the defence of freedom. There is no higher cause than freedom. And in these two monuments we see the challenges we have overcome as an Alliance. We deterred the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Stopped wars and atrocities in the Balkans. Fought terrorism from Afghanistan to the Middle East. Welcomed the newly free nations of Central and Eastern Europe into our Alliance - helping to spread democracy, peace and prosperity. And NATO’s door remains open. This year the Republic of North Macedonia signed the accession protocol. And with your support, North Macedonia will soon become the thirtieth member of our Alliance. So, what started in 1949 with 12 members, has proven a powerful force for peace. An Alliance that others strive to join. Showing the historic success of NATO. But as you know, success in the past is not a guarantee of success in the future. We have to be frank… Questions are being asked on both sides of the Atlantic about the strength of our partnership. And yes, there are differences. We are an Alliance of many different nations. With different geography, history and political parties. Republicans and Democrats. Conservatives and Labour. Independents, greens and many more. This is democracy. Open discussion and different views are not a sign of weakness. It is a sign of strength. So, we should not be surprised when we see differences between our countries. Today there are disagreements on issues such as trade, energy, climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. These are serious issues and serious disagreements. But we should remember that we’ve had our disagreements before. The Suez Crisis in 1956. The French withdrawal from military cooperation in NATO in 1966. And the Iraq War in 2003, Which was strongly supported by some Allies. And equally strongly opposed by others. The strength of NATO is that despite our differences, we have always been able to unite around our core task. To defend each other. Protect each other. And to keep our people safe. We have overcome our disagreements in the past. And we must overcome our differences now. Because we will need our Alliance even more in the future. We face unprecedented challenges, challenges no one nation can face alone The global balance of power is shifting. The fight against terrorism is a generational fight. We have only just seen the beginning of the threats in cyber space. Artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and big data could change the nature of conflict more fundamentally than the Industrial Revolution. And we will need to continue to deal with a more assertive Russia. In 2014, Russia illegally annexed Crimea. The first time in Europe that one country had taken part of another by force since World War Two. We see a pattern of Russian behaviour. Including a massive military build-up from the Arctic to the Mediterranean and from the Black Sea to the Baltic. The use of a military-grade nerve agent in the United Kingdom. Support for Assad’s murderous regime in Syria. Consistent cyber-attacks on NATO Allies and partners, targeting everything from Parliaments to power grids. Sophisticated disinformation campaigns. And attempts to interfere in democracy itself. NATO has responded with the biggest reinforcement of our collective defence in decades. For the first time, we have combat-ready troops deployed in the east of our Alliance. We have increased the readiness of our forces. Tripled the size of the NATO Response Force. Modernized our command structure. Bolstered our cyber defences. And we have stepped up support for our close partners, Georgia and Ukraine, sovereign nations with the sovereign right to choose their own path. We do all of this not to provoke a conflict. But to prevent a conflict. And to preserve the peace. Not to fight, but to deter. Not to attack, but to defend. There is no contradiction between deterrence, defence and dialogue. We do not want to isolate Russia. We strive for a better relationship with Russia. But even without a better relationship, we still need to manage a difficult one. So, we need to talk. And we do talk. To reduce risks, to avoid incidents, accidents and miscalculations. We also need dialogue in order to work for arms control. My generation was shaped by the deployment of thousands of nuclear missiles in Europe in the 1980s. Missiles capable of destroying our cities and killing millions of people in moments. Thanks to the vision and leadership of President Reagan and Premier Gorbachov, the INF Treaty put an end to all these weapons. But today, they are back. Russia has deployed new missiles in Europe. They are mobile. Hard to detect. Nuclear capable. Cut the warning time to just minutes. And reduce the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict. NATO’s position is united and clear… Russia is in violation of the INF Treaty. There are no new American missiles in Europe. But there are new Russian missiles. I continue to call on Russia to return to compliance with the INF Treaty. But so far Russia has taken no steps to do so. And time is running out. We do not want a new arms race. We do not want a new Cold War. But we must not be naive. An agreement that is only respected by one side will not keep us safe. So we must also prepare for a world without the INF Treaty. We will be measured and coordinated. We will not mirror what Russia is doing. NATO has no intention of deploying land-based nuclear missiles in Europe. But NATO will always take the necessary steps to provide credible and effective deterrence. Madam Speaker, Mr Vice President, The fight against terrorism also demands our collective effort. The attacks on 9/11 made that clear. NATO’s response to those attacks was swift. Within 24 hours, and for the first and only time in our history, we invoked Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. The collective defence clause, which states… “an armed attack against one… shall be considered an attack against them all”. So, 9/11 was not only an attack against the United States. But against all NATO Allies. Within days, NATO aircraft were patrolling American skies. And in the wake of 9/11, NATO soldiers went to fight side-by-side in Afghanistan. To prevent that country from ever again becoming a safe haven for terrorists, who could attack us here at home. Over the years, hundreds of thousands of troops from Europe and Canada have served in Afghanistan. Over a thousand have paid the ultimate price. And many more have been seriously wounded. We honour their service and their sacrifice. NATO remains in Afghanistan today. To fight terrorism and to train Afghan forces. Our goal is not to stay there forever. We should not stay any longer than is necessary. We went in together. We will decide on our future presence together. And when the time comes, we will leave together. NATO fully supports the peace process. It must pave the way for Afghan reconciliation. There can only be peace, if Afghanistan stays free from international terrorists. And for peace to be sustainable it must build on our achievements. NATO has created the conditions for social and economic progress. Bringing education and human rights to women and girls. Their rights must be preserved. NATO is not only fighting terrorism in Afghanistan. We are also part of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. The Coalition has made remarkable progress Once, ISIS controlled an area roughly the size of Virginia. And imposed their twisted ideology on millions. They beheaded people. Burned people alive. And traded women as sex slaves. We should never forget their brutality And thanks to American leadership and our collective efforts, we have stopped this brutality, and millions of people have been liberated. But our work is not done. That is why NATO is stepping up our training of Iraqi forces. So, they can better defend their country. And make sure that ISIS can never return. That is also why NATO supports our partners in the Middle East and North Africa. Helping them to build-up their intelligence services, border security, cyber security and special-operations forces. Training local forces and building local capacity are among the best weapons we have in the fight against terrorism. Prevention is better than intervention. Madam Speaker, Mr Vice-President, Some of you here today will have been directly affected by terrorism. You may have lost friends and loved ones. You know the reality of terrorism. I know it too. I was Prime Minister of Norway on the 22nd of July 2011. A date that will live in infamy in the history of my country. That day a terrorist detonated a bomb outside my office. Killing eight people and injuring many more. He then went to the island of Utøya. Where young people were enjoying a summer camp. He killed a further 69 people. Most of them teenagers with their whole lives ahead of them. It was the darkest day in Norway since the Second World War. It was the darkest day of my life. Terrorism comes in many forms. Some perpetrators misuse religion. Others misuse political ideology. They claim to be different from each other, fighting for different causes. But they are all the same. They believe in hatred, violence, and killing innocent men, women and children. They are nothing more than cowards. Terrorists attack our freedom, our values and our way of life. Our answer must be more openness and more democracy. Our values will prevail. Freedom will prevail over oppression. Tolerance over intolerance. And love will always prevail over hate. I see this in the flowers laid outside the mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. I see this in the lives led by the young survivors of the attacks in Norway. And I see this in New York and Washington Two indomitable cities. Cities that were not intimidated. Not defeated. But which rose stronger than ever from the horror of that September morning. Madam Speaker, Mr Vice-President, NATO is a strong alliance. But to remain a strong alliance, NATO must be a fair alliance. In an ideal world, we would not need to spend any money on defence. But we do not live in an ideal world. Freedom has enemies, and they need to be deterred. And if deterrence fails, we need to fight. Hitler could not have been stopped with peaceful protest. Stalin could not have been deterred with words. ISIS could not have been defeated with dialogue. Future enemies of freedom may choose violence again. Our desire for a peaceful world is simply not enough. We must act – and invest – to make it so. NATO Allies must spend more on defence. This has been the clear message from President Trump. And this message is having a real impact. After years of reducing defence budgets. All Allies have stopped the cuts. And all Allies have increased their defence spending. Before they were cutting billions. Now they are adding billions. In just the last two years, European Allies and Canada have spent an additional 41 billion dollars on defence. By the end of next year, that figure will rise to one hundred billion. This is making NATO stronger. That money allows us to invest in the new capabilities our armed forces need. Including advanced fighter aircraft, attack helicopters, missile defence and surveillance drones. This is good for Europe, and it is good for America. America’s NATO Allies provide important capabilities. Including tens of thousands of intelligence personnel and cyber experts. Giving the United States better eyes and ears where you need them, from tracking submarines in the Arctic to taking down the cyber network of ISIS. And Europe provides the US with a platform to project power around the world. Last year, I was in Fort Worth, Texas. I saw how industries from many NATO allies are working together to produce next generation strike-fighter aircraft. NATO has always had a technological edge. To keep that edge, we must innovate and capitalize on the ingenuity of our industries and our best minds. On both sides of the Atlantic. This will continue to provide us with advanced capabilities. And create jobs in the United States, Canada and Europe. So our transatlantic bond is not just about security. It is also about prosperity. It is not by chance that Article 2 of the Washington Treaty encourages economic collaboration between our nations. Europe and America have long been, by far, each other’s largest trading partners. Creating millions of jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. Generating more than three billion dollars a day in trade. Injecting trillions of dollars into our economies. There is more wealth, greater health, better education and more happiness, thanks to the bond between our two continents. Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice-President, The ultimate expression of burden sharing is that we stand together. Fight together. And, sometimes, die together. I have visited Arlington National Cemetery to pay tribute to all those American soldiers who have given their lives. Many of them in defence of Europe. Two World Wars and the Cold War made it clear how important America is to the security of Europe. And equally, that peace and stability in Europe is important to the United States. Our Alliance has not lasted for seventy years out of a sense of nostalgia. Or of sentiment. NATO lasts because it is in the national interest of each and every one of our nations. Together, we represent almost one billion people. We are half of the world’s economic might. And half of the world’s military might. When we stand together, we are stronger than any potential challenger – economically, politically and militarily. We need this collective strength. Because we will face new threats. And we have seen so many times before how difficult it is to predict the future. We were not able to predict the fall of the Berlin Wall. The 9/11 attacks. Or the rise of ISIS. Or Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea. Since we cannot foresee the future, we have to be prepared for the unforeseen. We need a strategy to deal with uncertainty. We have one. That strategy is NATO. A strong and agile NATO reduces risks. And enables us to deal with surprises when they happen. And they will happen. NATO is the most successful Alliance in history because we have always been able to change as the world changes. And because, despite our differences, we are united in our commitment to each other. NATO is an alliance of sovereign nations. United by democracy, liberty and the rule of law. By a person’s right to live their life in the pursuit of happiness. Free from oppression. Values that lie at the heart of the United States. And at the heart of NATO. As President Eisenhower, NATO’s first Supreme Allied Commander, said, “We are concerned not only with the protection of territory… but with the defence of a way of life.” Europe and North America are not separated by the Atlantic Ocean. We are united by it. And just like the Atlantic, NATO unites our continents. Our nations. And our people. It has done so for 70 years. And today we must do everything in our power to maintain that unity for future generations. Because come what may, We are stronger and safer when we stand together. Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, It is good to have friends. Thank you.",199,235,0,Democrat,53,48,2,Republican,116
Emmanuel Macron,French Republic,220,4,2018,President ,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Honorable Members of the United States Congress, Ladies and gentlemen: It is an honor for France, for the French people and for me to be received in this sanctuary of democracy where so much of the history of the United States has been written. We are surrounded today with images, portraits and symbols which reminds us that France has participated with heart in hand in the story of this great nation from the very beginning. We have fought shoulder-to-shoulder many battles starting with those that gave birth to the United States of America. Since then, we have shared a common vision for humanity. Our two nations are rooted in the same soil, grounded in the same ideals of the American and French Revolutions. We have worked together for the universal ideals of liberty, tolerance and equal rights. And yet, this is also about our human, gutsy, personal bonds throughout history. In 1778, the French philosopher Voltaire and Benjamin Franklin met in Paris. John Adams tells a story that after they had shaken hands they embraced each other by hugging one another in their arms and kissing each other’s cheeks. It can remind you of something. And this morning, I stand under the protective gaze of La Fayette right behind me. As a brave young man, he fought alongside George Washington and forged a tight relationship fueled by respect and affection. La Fayette used to call himself a son of the United States and in 1792 George Washington became a son of America and France when our first republic awarded citizenship to him. Here we stand in your beautiful capital city whose plans were conceived by a French architect, Charles L’Enfant. The miracle of the relationship between the United States and France is that we have never lost the special bond deeply rooted, not only in our history, but also in our flesh. This is why I invited President Donald Trump for the first Bastille Day Parade of my presidency on the 14th of July last year. Today, President Trump’s decision to offer France his first state visit to Washington has a particular resonance because it represents the continuity of our shared history in a troubled world. And let me thank your president and the First Lady for this wonderful invitation to my wife and myself. I am also very grateful and I would like also to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for welcoming me on this occasion. And I will like to specially thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your invitation. I want you to know how much I appreciate this unique gesture. Thank you, sir. The strength of all bonds is the source of our shared ideals. This is what united us in the struggle against imperialism during the First World War, then in the fight against Nazism during the Second World War. This is what united us again during the era of the Stalinist threat. And now, we lean on that strength to fight against terrorist groups. Let us for a moment transport ourselves to the past. Imagine, this is July 4, 1916. Back then, the United States had not entered World War I. And yet, a young American poet enlisted in the ranks of our Foreign Legion because he loved France and he loved the cause of freedom. This young American would fight and die on Independence Day at Belloy-an-Santerre, not far from Amiens, my hometown, after having written these words: I have a rendezvous with death. The name of this young American was Alan Seeger. A statue stands in his honor in Paris. Since 1776, we, the American and French people, have had a rendezvous with freedom. And with it comes sacrifices. That is why we are very honored by the presence today of Robert Jackson Ewald, a World War II veteran. Robert Jackson Ewald took part in the D-Day landing. He fought for our freedom 74 years ago. Sir, on behalf of France, thank you. I bow to your courage and your devotion. In recent years, our nations have suffered wrenching losses simply because of our values and our taste for freedom. Because these values are the very ones those terrorists precisely hate. Tragically, on September 11, 2001, many Americans had an unexpected rendezvous with death. Over the last 5 years, my country and Europe also experienced terrible terrorist attacks. And we shall never forget these innocent victims nor the incredible resilience of our people in the aftermath. It is a horrific price to pay for freedom, for democracy. That is why we stand together in Syria and in Israel today. To fight together against these terrorist groups who seek to destroy everything for which we stand. We have encountered countless rendezvous with deaths because we have this constant attachment to freedom and democracy. As emblazoned on the flags of the French Revolutionaries: Vivre libre ou mourir. ""Live free or die."" Thankfully, freedom is also the source of all that is worth living for. Freedom is a call to think and to love. It is a call to our will. That is why, in times of peace, France and the United States were able to forge unbreakable bonds from the grief of painful memories. The most indestructible, the most powerful, the most definitive knot between us is the ones that ties the true purpose of our people to advance -- as Abraham Lincoln said, the ""unfinished"" business of democracy. Indeed, our two societies have stood up to advance the human rights for all. They have engaged in a continual dialogue to impact this unfinished business. In this Capitol Rotunda, the bust of Martin Luther King, assassinated 50 years ago, reminds us of the inspiration of African-American leaders, artists, writers who have become part of our common heritage. We celebrate, among them, James Baldwin and Richard Wright, whom France hosted on our soil. We have shared the history of civil rights. France’s Simone de Beauvoir became a respected figure in the movement for gender equality in America in the 70s. Women’s rights have long been a fundamental driver for our societies on both sides of the Atlantic. This explains why the Me Too Movement has recently had such a deep resonance in France. Democracy is made of day-to-day conversation and mutual understanding between citizens. It is easier and deeper when we have the ability to speak each other’s language. The heart of Francophonie also beats hear in the United States. From New Orleans to Seattle, I want this heart to beat even harder in American schools all across the country. Democracy relies also on the faculty of freely describing the present and the capacity to invent a future. This is what culture brings. Thousands of examples come to mind when we think of the exchanges between our cultures across the centuries. From Tomas Jefferson, who was ambassador to France and built his house in Monticello based on a building he loved in Paris, to Hemmingway’s novel, [A] Moveable Feast, celebrating the capital city of France. From our great 19th century French writer, Cheateaubriand, bring to the French people the dream of American’s open spaces, forests and mountains, to Faulkner’s novels crafted in the Deep South that first read in France where they quickly gained literary praise; from Jazz coming from Louisiana and the Blues from Mississippi finding in France an enthusiastic public to the American fascination for Impressionists and the French Modern and Contemporary Arts. These exchanges are vibrant in so many fields: from cinema to fashion, from design to high cuisine, from sports to visual arts. Medicine and scientific research as well as business and innovation are also significant parts of our shared journey. The United States is France’s first scientific partner. Our economic ties create hundreds of thousands of jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. The story of France and the United States is a story of an endless dialogue made of common dreams of a common struggle for dignity and progress. It is the best achievement of our democratic principles and values. This is this very special relationship. This is us. But we must remember the warning of President Theodore Roosevelt [Ronald Reagan]: Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, handed on for them to do the same.4 This is an urgent reminder indeed because now, going beyond our bilateral ties, beyond our very special relationship, Europe and the United States must face together the global challenges of the century. And we cannot take for granted our transatlantic history and bonds. At the core, our Western values, themselves, are at risk. We have to succeed facing these challenges and we cannot succeed in forgetting our principles and our history. In fact, the 21st Century have brought a series of new threats and new challenges that our ancestors might not ever have imagined. Our strongest beliefs are challenged by the rise of a yet unknown new world order. Our societies are concerned about the future of their children. All of us gathered here in this noble chamber, we elected officials all share a responsibility to demonstrate that democracy remains the best answer to the questions and doubts that are raised today. Even if the foundations of our progress are disrupted we must stand firmly and fight to make our principles prevail. But we bear another responsibility inherited from our collected history. Today, the international community needs to step up our game and build the 21st Century world order based on the perennial principles we established together after World War II. The rule of law, the fundamental values in which we secured peace for 70 years, are now questioned by urgent issues that require our joint action. Together, with our international allies and partners, we are facing inequalities created by globalization; threats to the planet our common good; attacks on democracy through the rise of liberalism; and the destabilization of our international community by new powers and criminal states. All these risks aggrieve our citizens. Both in the United States and in Europe, we are living in a time of anger and fear because of these current threats. But these feelings do not build anything. You can play with fears and angers for a time but they do not construct anything. Anger only freezes and weakens us. And as Franklin Delano Roosevelt said during his first inaugural speech: “The only thing we have to fear, it is fear itself.” Therefore, let me say we have two possible ways ahead. We can choose isolationism, withdrawal, and nationalism. This is an option. It can be tempting to us as a temporary remedy to our fears. But closing the door to the world will not stop the evolution of the world. It will not douse but inflame the fears of our citizens. We have to keep our eyes wide open to the new risks right in front of us. I’m convinced that if we decide to open our eyes wider we will be stronger. We will overcome the dangers. We will not let the rampaging work of extreme nationalism shake a world full of hope for greater prosperity. It is a critical moment. If we do not act with urgency as a global community I am convinced that the international institutions, including the United Nations and NATO, will no longer be able to exercise a mandate and stabilizing influence. We would then inevitably and severely undermine the liberal order we built after World War II. All the powers, with the strongest strategy and ambition, will then feel the void we would leave empty. All the powers will not hesitate one second to advocate their own model to shape the 21st century world order. Personally, if you ask me, I do not share the fascination for new strong powers, the abandonment of freedom, and the illusion of nationalism. Therefore, distinguished members of the congress, let us push them aside; write our own history and birth the future we want. We have to shape our common answers to the global threats that we are facing. The only option then is to strengthen our cooperation. We can build the 21st century world order based on a new breed of multilateralism, based on a more effective, accountable and results-oriented multilateralism -- a strong multilateralism. This requires, more than ever, the United States’ involvement, as your role was decisive for creating and safeguarding today’s free world. The United States is the one who invented this multilateralism. You are the one now who has to help to preserve and reinvent it. This strong multilateralism will not outshine our national cultures and national identities. It is exactly the other was around. A strong multilateralism will allow our cultures and identities to be respected, to be protected, and to flourish freely together. Why? Because precisely our own cultures is based on both sides of the Atlantic, of this unique taste for freedom, on this unique attachment for liberty and peace. This strong multilateralism is the unique option compatible with our nations, our cultures, our identities. With the U.S. president, with the support of every 535 members of this joint session, representing the whole American nation, we can actively contribute together to building the 21st century world order for our people. The United States -- the United States and Europe have a historical role in this respect because it is the only way to defend what we believe in; to promote universal values; to express strongly that human rights, the rights of minorities and shared liberty are the true answer to the disorders of the world. I believe in these rights and values. I believe that against ignorance, we have education; against inequalities, development; against cynicism, trust and good faith; against fanaticism, culture; against disease and epidemics, medicine; against the threats on the planet, science. I believe in concrete action. I believe the solutions are in our hands. I believe in the liberation of the individual and in the freedom and responsibility of everyone to build their own lives and pursue happiness. I believe in the power of intelligently regulated market economies. We are experiencing the positive impact of our current economy globalization with innovations, with jobs creations, with the, however, the abuses of globalized capitalism and digital disruptions which jeopardize the stability of our economies and democracies. I believe facing these challenges requires the opposite of massive deregulation and extreme nationalism. Commercial war is not the proper answer to these evolutions. We need a free and fair trade for sure. A commercial war opposing allies is not consistent with our mission, with our history, with our current commitment for global security. At the end of the day, it will destroy jobs, increase prices, and the middle class will have to pay for it. I believe we can build the right answers to legitimate concerns regarding trade and balances, excesses and over capacities, by negotiating through the World Trade Organization and building cooperative solutions. We wrote these rules. We should follow them. I believe we can address our citizens’ concerns regarding privacy and personal data. The recent Facebook -- the recent Facebook hearings highlighted the necessity to preserve our citizens’ digital rights all over the world and protect the confidence in today’s digital tools of life. The European Union passed a new regulation for data protection. I believe the United States and the European Union should cooperate to find the right balance between innovation and ethics, and harness the best of today’s revolutions in digital data and artificial intelligence. I believe facing inequality should push us to improve policy coordination within the G20 to reduce financial speculation and create mechanisms to protect the middle class’ interests because our middle classes are the back bone of our democracies. I believe in building a better future for our children which requires offering them a planet that is still habitable in 25 years. Some people think that securing current industries and their jobs is more urgent than transforming our economies to meet the global challenge of climate change. I hear -- I hear these concerns but we must find a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy. Because what is the meaning of our life, really, if we work and live destroying the planet while sacrificing the future of our children? What is the meaning of our life if our decision, our conscious decision, is to reduce the opportunities for our children or grandchildren? By polluting the oceans, not mitigating CO2 emissions, and destroying our biodiversity, we are killing our planet. Let us face it. There is no planet B. On this issue, it may happen we have disagreements between the United States and France. It may happen, like in all families. But that for me is short-term disagreement. On the long-run we will have to face some realities and we’re just citizens of the same planet. So we will have to face it. So beyond some short-term disagreements we have to work together. With business leaders and local communities, let us work together in order to make our planet great again and create new jobs and new opportunities while safeguarding our Earth. And I am sure, one day, the United States will come back and join the Paris Agreement. And I am sure -- and I am sure we can work together to fulfil with you the ambitions of the Global Compact on the environment. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe in democracy. Many of our forebears were slain for the cause of freedom and human rights. With the great inheritance they gave us comes the responsibility to continue their mission in this new century and to preserve the perennial values handed to us and assure that today’s unprecedented innovations in science and technology remain a service of liberty and in the preservation of our planet for the next generations. To protect our democracies, we have to fight against the ever-growing virus of fake news which exposes our people to irrational fear and imaginary risks. And let me attribute the fair copyright for this expression “fake news,” especially here. Without reason, without truth, there is no real democracy, because democracy is about true choices and rational decisions. The corruption of information is an attempt to corrode the very spirit of our democracies. We also have to fight against the terrorist propaganda that spreads out its fanaticism on the internet. It has a gripping influence on some of our citizens and children. I want this fight to be part of our bilateral commitment and will discuss with your president the importance of such an agenda. I want this fight to be part of the G7 agenda because, here again, it deeply harms our rights and shared values. The terrorist threat is even more dangerous when it is combined with the nuclear proliferation threat. We must therefore be stricter than ever with countries seeking to acquire the nuclear bomb. That is why France supports fully the United States in its efforts to bring Pyongyang, through sanctions and negotiations, towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. As for Iran, our objective is clear. Iran shall never possess any nuclear weapons. Not now. Not in five years. Not in 10 years. Never. But this policy should never lead us to war in the Middle East. We must ensure stability and respect sovereignty of the nations, including that one of Iran which represents a great civilization. Let us not replicate past mistakes in the region. Let us not be naive on one side. Let us not create new walls, ourselves on the other side. There is an existing framework, called the JCPOA, to control the nuclear activity of Iran. We signed it at the initiative of the United States. We signed it, both the United States and France. That is why we cannot say we should get rid of it like that. But it is true to say that this agreement may not address all concerns, and very important concerns. This is true. But we should not abandon it without having something substantial and more substantial instead. That’s my position. That’s why France will not leave the JCPOA, because we signed it. Your president and your country will have to take in the current days and weeks its own responsibilities regarding this issue. But what I want to do, and what we decided together with your president, is that we can work on a more comprehensive deal addressing all these concerns. That is why we have to work on this more comprehensive deal based, as discussed with President Trump yesterday, on four pillars. The substance of the existing agreement, especially if you decide to leave it, the post-2025 period, in order to be sure that we will never have any nuclear activity for Iran, the containment of the military influence of the Iranian regime in the region, and the monitoring of ballistic activity. I think these four pillars, the one I addressed in front of the General Assembly of the United Nation last September, are the one which cover the legitimate fears of the United States and our allies in the region. I think we have to start working now on these four pillars, to build this new comprehensive deal and to be sure that whatever the decision of the United States will be, we will not leave the floor to the absence of rule. We will not leave the floor to these conflicts of powers in Middle East. We will not fuel ourselves in increasing tensions and potential war. That’s my position and I think we can work together to build this comprehensive deal for the whole region, for our people, because I think it fairly addresses our concerns. That’s my position. Thank you very much. And this containment, I mentioned in one of these pillars, is necessary in Yemen, in Lebanon, in Iraq, and also in Syria. Building a sustainable peace in a united and inclusive Syria requires, indeed, that all powers in the region respect the sovereignty of its people and the diversity of its communities. In Syria, we work very closely together. After prohibited weapons were used against the population by the regime of Bashar Al-Assad two weeks ago, the United States and France, together with the United Kingdom, acted to destroy chemical facilities and to restore the credibility of the international community. This action was one of the best evidence of this strong multilateralism. And I want to pay special tribute for our soldiers because they did a very great job in this region and in this occasion. Beyond this action, we will together work for humanitarian solution on the short-term, on the ground, and contribute actively to a lasting political solution to put an end to this tragic conflict. And I think one of the very important decision we took together with President Trump was precisely to include Syria in this large framework for the overall region, and to decide to work together in this political deal for Syria, for Syrian people, even after our war against ISIS. In the Sahel, where terrorist networks span a footprint as large as Europe, French and American soldiers are confronting the same enemy and risking their lives together. Here, I would like to pay special tribute to the American soldiers who fell this past fall in the region. And to their French comrades who lost their lives early this year in Mali. Better than anyone, I think, our troops know what the alliance and friendship between our country means. I believe facing all these challenges, all these fears, all this anger, our duty, our destiny is to work together and to build this new strong multilateralism. Distinguished members of Congress, ladies and gentlemen, on April 25, 1960, General de Gaulle affirmed in this chamber that nothing was as important to France as the reason, the resolution, the friendship of the great people of the United States. Fifty-eight years later, to this very day, I come here to convey the warmest feelings of the French nation and to tell you that our people cherish the friendship of the American people with as much intensity as ever. The United States and the American people are an essential part of our confidence in the future, in democracy, in what women and men can accomplish in this world when we are driven by high ideals and an unbreakable trust in humanity and progress. Today, the call we hear is the call of history. This is a time of determination and courage. What we cherish is at stake. What we love is in danger. We have no choice but to prevail. And together, we shall prevail. Long live the United States of America ! Long live the friendship between France and the United States of America! Long live the Republic! Long live France ! Long live our friendship ! Thank you.",241,194,0,Republican,51,47,2,Republican,115
Narendra Modi,Republic of India,750,6,2016,Prime Minister,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Distinguished Members of the U.S. Congress, Ladies and Gentlemen: I'm deeply honored by the invitation to address this Joint Meeting of the U.S. Congress. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for opening the doors of this magnificent Capitol. This temple of democracy has encouraged and empowered other democracies the world over. It manifests the spirit of this great nation, which -- which in Abraham Lincoln’s words, ""was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."" In granting me this opportunity, you have honored the world’s largest democracy and its 1.25 billion people. As a representative of [the] world’s largest democracy, it is indeed a privilege to speak to the leaders of its oldest. Mr. Speaker, Two days ago, I began my visit by going to the Arlington National Cemetery -- the final resting place of many brave soldiers of this great land. I honored their courage and sacrifice for the ideals of freedom and democracy. It was also the 72nd Anniversary of the D-Day. On that day, thousands from this great country fought to protect the torch of liberty. They sacrificed their lives so that the world lives in freedom. I applaud, India applauds, the great sacrifices of the men and women from ""The Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave"" in service of mankind. India knows what this means because our soldiers have fallen in distant battlefields for the same ideals. That is why the threads of freedom and liberty form a strong bond between our two democracies. Mr. Speaker, Our nations may have been shaped by diverse histories, cultures, and faiths. Yet, our belief in democracy for our nations and liberty for our countrymen is common. The idea that all citizens are created equal is a central pillar of the American Constitution. Our founding fathers too shared the same belief and sought individual liberty for every citizen of India. There were many who doubted India when, as a newly independent nation, we reposed our faith in democracy. Indeed, wagers were made on our future. But, the people of India did not waver. Our founders created a modern nation with freedom, democracy, and equality as the essence of its soul. And in doing so, they ensured that we continued to celebrate our age-old diversity. Today, across its individuals and institutions, its -- in its villages and cities, industries and streets, are anchored in equal respect for all faiths. And in the melody of hundreds of its languages and dialects, India lives as one; India grows as one; India celebrates as one. Mr. Speaker, Modern India is in its 70th and year. For my government, the Constitution is its real holy book. And in that holy book, freedom of faith, speech and franchise, and equality of all citizens, regardless of background, are enshrined as fundamental rights. Eight hundred million of my countrymen may exercise the freedom of franchise once every five years. But all the 1.25 billion of our citizens have freedom from fear, a freedom they exercise every moment of their lives. Distinguished Members, Engagement between our democracies has been visible in the manner in which our thinkers impacted one another, and shaped the course of our societies. Thoreau’s idea of Civil Disobedience influenced our political thoughts. And similarly the call by the great sage of India, Swami Vivekananda, to embrace humanity was most famously delivered in Chicago. Ghandi’s non-violence inspired the heroism of Martin Luther King. Today, a mere distance of three miles separates the Martin Luther King Memorial at Tidal Basin from the statue of Gandhi at Massachusetts Avenue. This proximity of their memorials in Washington mirrors the closeness of ideals and value[s] they believed in. The genius of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was nurtured in the years he spent at the Columbia University a century ago. The impact of the U.S. Constitution on him was reflected in his drafting of the Indian Constitution some three decades later. Our independence was ignited by the same idealism that fuelled your struggle for freedom. No wonder then that former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee called India and the U.S. ""natural allies."" No wonder that the shared ideals and common philosophy of freedom shaped the bedrock of our ties. No wonder then that President Obama has called our ties “[one of] the defining partnership[s]of the 21st century.” Mr. Speaker, More than 15 years ago, Prime Minister Vajpayee stood here and gave a call to step out of the ""shadow of hesitation"" of the past. The pages of our friendship since then tell a remarkable story. Today, our relationship has overcome the hesitations of history. Comfort, candor, and convergence define our conversations. Through the cycle of elections and transitions of Administration[s], the intensity of our engagements has only grown. And in this exciting journey, the U.S. Congress has acted as its compass. You help us turn barriers into bridges of partnership. In the fall of 2008, when the Congress passed the India-U.S. Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, it changed the very colors of leaves of our relationship.2 We thank you for being there when the partnership needed you the most. You have also stood by us in times of sorrow. India will never forget the solidarity shown by the U.S. Congress when terrorists from across our border attacked Mumbai in November of 2008. And for this, we are grateful. Mr. Speaker, I'm informed that the working of the U.S. Congress is harmonious. I am also told that you are well-known for your bipartisanship. Well, you are not alone. Time and again, I also witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament, especially in Upper House. So, as you can see, we have many shared practices. Mr. Speaker, As this country knows well, every journey has its pioneers. Very early on, they shaped a development partnership even when our meeting ground was more limited. The genius of Norman Borlaug brought the Green Revolution and food security to my country. The excellence of the American universities nurtured institutions of technology and management in India. And, I could go on. But fast forward to the present. The embrace of our partnership extend[s] to the totality of human endeavor --from the depths of the oceans to the vastness of the space. Our Science and Technology Collaboration continues to helps us in cracking the age-old problems in the fields of public health, education, food, and agriculture. Ties of commerce and investment are flourishing. We trade more with the U.S. than with any other nation. And the flow of goods, services, and capital between us generates jobs in both our societies. As in trade, so in defense. India exercise[s] with the United States more than we do with any other partner. Defense purchases have moved from almost zero to 10 billion dollars in less than a decade. Our cooperation also secures our cities and citizens from terrorists, and protects our critical infrastructure from cyber threats. Civil Nuclear cooperation, as I told President Obama yesterday, is a reality. Mr. Speaker, Our people-to-people links are strong; and there is close cultural connect between our societies. Siri -- you are familiar with the Siri -- Siri tells us that India’s ancient heritage of Yoga has over 30 million practitioners in the U.S. It is estimated that more Americans bend for yoga than to throw a curve ball. And no, Mr. Speaker, we have not yet claimed intellectual property right on Yoga. Connecting our two nations is also a unique and dynamic bridge of three million Indian Americans. Today, they are among your best CEOs, academics, astronauts, scientists, economists, doctors -- even spelling bee champions. They are your strength. They are also the pride of India. They symbolize the best of both our societies. Mr. Speaker, My understanding of your great country began long before I entered public office. Long before assuming office, I travelled coast to coast, covering more than 25 States of America. I realized then that the real strength of the U.S. was in the dreams of its people and the boldness of their ambitions. Today Mr. Speaker, a similar spirit animates India. Our 800 million youth are especially impatient. India is undergoing a profound social and economic change. A billion of its citizens are already politically empowered. My dream is to economically empower them through many social and economical transformations -- and do so by 2022, the 75th anniversary of India’s independence. My to-do list is long and ambitious -- but you will understand. It includes: a vibrant rural economy with a robust farm sector; a roof over each head and electricity for all households; to skill -- to skill millions of our youth; build [a] hundred smart cities; have a broad band for a billion, and connect our villages to the digital world; and create a 21st-century rail, road, and port infrastructure. These are not just aspirations. They are goals to be reached in a finite time-frame. And to be achieved with a light carbon foot print, with greater emphasis on renewables. Mr. Speaker, In every sector of India’s forward march, I see the U.S. as an indispensable partner. Many of you also believe that a stronger and prosperous India is in America’s strategic interest. Let us work together to convert shared ideals into practical cooperation. There can be no doubt that in advancing this relationship both nations stand to gain. As the U.S. businesses search for new areas of economic growth, markets for their goods, a pool of skilled resources, and a global location to produce and manufacture, India could be their ideal partner. India’s strong economy and growth rate of 7.6% annum is creating a new opportunities for our mutual prosperity. Transformative American technologies in India and growing investment by Indian companies in the United States both have a positive impact on the lives of our citizens. Today, for their global research and development centers, India is the destination of choice for the U.S. companies. Looking eastward from India, across the Pacific, the innovation strength of our two countries comes together in California. Here, the innovative genius of America and India’s intellectual creativity are working to shape new industries of the future. Mr. Speaker, The 21st century has brought with it great opportunities. But, it has also come with its own set of challenges. While some parts of the world are islands of growing economic prosperity, others are mired in conflicts. In Asia, the absence of an agreed security architecture creates uncertainty. Threats of terror are expanding and new challenges are emerging in cyber and outer space. And global institutions conceived in 20th century, seem unable to cope with new challenges or take on new responsibilities. In this world of multiple transitions and economic opportunities, growing uncertainties and political complexities, existing threats and new challenges -- our engagement can make a difference by promoting: - cooperation not dominance; - connectivity not isolation; - inclusive not exclusive mechanisms; - respect for global commons; - and above all, to international rules and norms. India is already assuming her responsibilities in securing the Indian Ocean region. A strong India-U.S. partnership can anchor peace, prosperity, and stability from Asia to Africa and from Indian Ocean to the Pacific. It can also help ensure security of the sea lanes of commerce and freedom of navigation on seas. But the effectiveness of our cooperation would increase if international institutions, framed with the mindset of the 20th century, were to reflect the realities of today. Mr. Speaker, Before arriving in Washington D.C., I had visited Herat in Western Afghanistan to inaugurate Afghan-India Friendship Dam, built with Indian assistance. I was also there on the Christmas Day last year to dedicate to that proud nation its Parliament, a testimony to our democratic ties. Afghans naturally recognize that the sacrifices of America have helped create a better life. But your contribution in keeping the region safe and secure is deeply appreciated by -- even beyond. And India too has made an enormous contribution and sacrifices to support our friendship with Afghan people. A commitment to rebuild a peaceful, and stable and prosperous Afghanistan is our shared objective. Yet, Distinguished Members, not just in Afghanistan but elsewhere in South Asia and globally, terrorism remains the biggest threat. In the territory -- In the territory stretching from West of India’s border of -- to Africa, it may go by different names -- from Laskhar-e-Taiba to Taliban to ISIS -- but its philosophy is common: of hate, murder, and violence. Although it is a shadow is spreading across the world, it is incubated in India’s neighborhood. I commend the members of the U.S. Congress for sending a clear message to those who preach and practice terrorism for political gains. Refusing [to] reward them is the first step towards holding them accountable for their actions. The fight against terrorism has to be fought at many levels. And the traditional tools of military intelligence or diplomacy alone would not be able to win this fight. Mr. Speaker, We have both lost civilians and soldiers in combating terrorism. The need of the hour is for us to deepen our security cooperation -- and base it on a policy that isolates those who harbor, support, and sponsor terrorists; that does not distinguish between ""good"" and ""bad"" terrorists; and that delinks religion from terrorism. Also, for us to succeed, those who believe in humanity must come together to fight for it as one and speak against this menace in one voice. Terrorism must be delegitimized. Mr. Speaker, The benefits of our partnership extend not just to the nations and regions that need it most. On our own, and by combining our capacities, we are also responding to other global challenges, including when disaster strikes and where humanitarian relief is needed. Far from our shores, we have evacuated thousands from Yemen -- Americans, Indians, and others. Nearer home, we are the first responders during Nepal’s earthquake, in the Maldives water crisis, and most recently during landslide in Sri Lanka. We are also one of the largest contributor[s] of troops to U.N. peacekeeping operations. Often, India and the U.S. have combined their strengths in science and technology and innovation to help fight hunger, poverty, disease, and [il]literacy in different parts of the world. The success of our partnership is also opening up new opportunities for learning, security, and development from Asia to Africa. And the protection of [the] environment and caring for the planet is central for our shared vision of a just world. For us in India, to live in harmony with Mother Earth is a part of our ancient belief. And to take from nature only what is most essential is a part of our Indian culture. Our partnership, therefore, aims to balance responsibilities with capabilities. And it also focuses on new ways to increase the availability and use of renewable energy. A strong U.S. support for our initiative to form an International Solar Alliance is one such effort. We are working together not just for [a] better future for ourselves, but for the whole world. This has also been the goal of our efforts in G-20, East Asia Summit, and Climate Change summits. Mr. Speaker, As we deepen our partnership, there would be times when we would have differing perspectives. But since our interests and concerns converge, the autonomy in decision making and diversity in our perspectives can only add values to our partnership. So, as we embark on a new journey, and seek new goals, let us focus not just on matters routine but also transformational ideas -- ideas which can focus: - not just on creating wealth but also creating value for our societies; - not just on immediate gains but also long term benefits; - not just on sharing best practices but also shaping partnerships; - and not just on building a bright future of -- for our people, but in being a bridge to a more united, humane, and prosperous world. And, important for the success of this journey would be a need to view it with new eyes and new sensitivities. When [we] do this, we will realize the full promise of this extraordinary relationship. Mr. Speaker, In my final thoughts and words let me emphasize that our relationship is primed for a momentous future. The constraints of the past are behind us and foundations of the future are firmly in place. In the lines of Walt Whitman, ""The Orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments, the baton has given the signal."" And to that, if I might add, there is a new symphony in play. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and Mr. Vice President, Distinguished members for this honor. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks a lot.",247,188,0,Republican,54,44,2,Republican,114
Pope Francis,Papal States,327,9,2015,Pope,"Mr. Vice-President, Mr. Speaker, Honorable Members of Congress, Dear Friends, I am most grateful for your invitation to address this Joint Session of Congress in “the land of the free and the home of the brave”. I would like to think that the reason for this is that I too am a son of this great continent, from which we have all received so much and toward which we share a common responsibility. Each son or daughter of a given country has a mission, a personal and social responsibility. Your own responsibility as members of Congress is to enable this country, by your legislative activity, to grow as a nation. You are the face of its people, their representatives. You are called to defend and preserve the dignity of your fellow citizens in the tireless and demanding pursuit of the common good, for this is the chief aim of all politics. A political society endures when it seeks, as a vocation, to satisfy common needs by stimulating the growth of all its members, especially those in situations of greater vulnerability or risk. Legislative activity is always based on care for the people. To this you have been invited, called and convened by those who elected you. Yours is a work which makes me reflect in two ways on the figure of Moses. On the one hand, the patriarch and lawgiver of the people of Israel symbolizes the need of peoples to keep alive their sense of unity by means of just legislation. On the other, the figure of Moses leads us directly to God and thus to the transcendent dignity of the human being. Moses provides us with a good synthesis of your work: you are asked to protect, by means of the law, the image and likeness fashioned by God on every human face. Today I would like not only to address you, but through you the entire people of the United States. Here, together with their representatives, I would like to take this opportunity to dialogue with the many thousands of men and women who strive each day to do an honest day’s work, to bring home their daily bread, to save money and –one step at a time – to build a better life for their families. These are men and women who are not concerned simply with paying their taxes, but in their own quiet way sustain the life of society. They generate solidarity by their actions, and they create organizations which offer a helping hand to those most in need. I would also like to enter into dialogue with the many elderly persons who are a storehouse of wisdom forged by experience, and who seek in many ways, especially through volunteer work, to share their stories and their insights. I know that many of them are retired, but still active; they keep working to build up this land. I also want to dialogue with all those young people who are working to realize their great and noble aspirations, who are not led astray by facile proposals, and who face difficult situations, often as a result of immaturity on the part of many adults. I wish to dialogue with all of you, and I would like to do so through the historical memory of your people. My visit takes place at a time when men and women of good will are marking the anniversaries of several great Americans. The complexities of history and the reality of human weakness notwithstanding, these men and women, for all their many differences and limitations, were able by hard work and self-sacrifice – some at the cost of their lives – to build a better future. They shaped fundamental values which will endure forever in the spirit of the American people. A people with this spirit can live through many crises, tensions and conflicts, while always finding the resources to move forward, and to do so with dignity. These men and women offer us a way of seeing and interpreting reality. In honoring their memory, we are inspired, even amid conflicts, and in the here and now of each day, to draw upon our deepest cultural reserves. I would like to mention four of these Americans: Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton. This year marks the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, the guardian of liberty, who labored tirelessly that “this nation, under God, [might] have a new birth of freedom”. Building a future of freedom requires love of the common good and cooperation in a spirit of subsidiarity and solidarity. All of us are quite aware of, and deeply worried by, the disturbing social and political situation of the world today. Our world is increasingly a place of violent conflict, hatred and brutal atrocities, committed even in the name of God and of religion. We know that no religion is immune from forms of individual delusion or ideological extremism. This means that we must be especially attentive to every type of fundamentalism, whether religious or of any other kind. A delicate balance is required to combat violence perpetrated in the name of a religion, an ideology or an economic system, while also safeguarding religious freedom, intellectual freedom and individual freedoms. But there is another temptation which we must especially guard against: the simplistic reductionism which sees only good or evil; or, if you will, the righteous and sinners. The contemporary world, with its open wounds which affect so many of our brothers and sisters, demands that we confront every form of polarization which would divide it into these two camps. We know that in the attempt to be freed of the enemy without, we can be tempted to feed the enemy within. To imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place. That is something which you, as a people, reject. Our response must instead be one of hope and healing, of peace and justice. We are asked to summon the courage and the intelligence to resolve today’s many geopolitical and economic crises. Even in the developed world, the effects of unjust structures and actions are all too apparent. Our efforts must aim at restoring hope, righting wrongs, maintaining commitments, and thus promoting the well-being of individuals and of peoples. We must move forward together, as one, in a renewed spirit of fraternity and solidarity, cooperating generously for the common good. The challenges facing us today call for a renewal of that spirit of cooperation, which has accomplished so much good throughout the history of the United States. The complexity, the gravity and the urgency of these challenges demand that we pool our resources and talents, and resolve to support one another, with respect for our differences and our convictions of conscience. In this land, the various religious denominations have greatly contributed to building and strengthening society. It is important that today, as in the past, the voice of faith continue to be heard, for it is a voice of fraternity and love, which tries to bring out the best in each person and in each society. Such cooperation is a powerful resource in the battle to eliminate new global forms of slavery, born of grave injustices which can be overcome only through new policies and new forms of social consensus. Here I think of the political history of the United States, where democracy is deeply rooted in the mind of the American people. All political activity must serve and promote the good of the human person and be based on respect for his or her dignity. “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”. If politics must truly be at the service of the human person, it follows that it cannot be a slave to the economy and finance. Politics is, instead, an expression of our compelling need to live as one, in order to build as one the greatest common good: that of a community which sacrifices particular interests in order to share, in justice and peace, its goods, its interests, its social life. I do not underestimate the difficulty that this involves, but I encourage you in this effort. Here too I think of the march which Martin Luther King led from Selma to Montgomery fifty years ago as part of the campaign to fulfill his “dream” of full civil and political rights for African Americans. That dream continues to inspire us all. I am happy that America continues to be, for many, a land of “dreams”. Dreams which lead to action, to participation, to commitment. Dreams which awaken what is deepest and truest in the life of a people. In recent centuries, millions of people came to this land to pursue their dream of building a future in freedom. We, the people of this continent, are not fearful of foreigners, because most of us were once foreigners. I say this to you as the son of immigrants, knowing that so many of you are also descended from immigrants. Tragically, the rights of those who were here long before us were not always respected. For those peoples and their nations, from the heart of American democracy, I wish to reaffirm my highest esteem and appreciation. Those first contacts were often turbulent and violent, but it is difficult to judge the past by the criteria of the present. Nonetheless, when the stranger in our midst appeals to us, we must not repeat the sins and the errors of the past. We must resolve now to live as nobly and as justly as possible, as we educate new generations not to turn their back on our “neighbors” and everything around us. Building a nation calls us to recognize that we must constantly relate to others, rejecting a mindset of hostility in order to adopt one of reciprocal subsidiarity, in a constant effort to do our best. I am confident that we can do this. Our world is facing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since the Second World War. This presents us with great challenges and many hard decisions. On this continent, too, thousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones, in search of greater opportunities. Is this not what we want for our own children? We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation. To respond in a way which is always humane, just and fraternal. We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome. Let us remember the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” (Mt 7:12). This Rule points us in a clear direction. Let us treat others with the same passion and compassion with which we want to be treated. Let us seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves. Let us help others to grow, as we would like to be helped ourselves. In a word, if we want security, let us give security; if we want life, let us give life; if we want opportunities, let us provide opportunities. The yardstick we use for others will be the yardstick which time will use for us. The Golden Rule also reminds us of our responsibility to protect and defend human life at every stage of its development. This conviction has led me, from the beginning of my ministry, to advocate at different levels for the global abolition of the death penalty. I am convinced that this way is the best, since every life is sacred, every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes. Recently my brother bishops here in the United States renewed their call for the abolition of the death penalty. Not only do I support them, but I also offer encouragement to all those who are convinced that a just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation. In these times when social concerns are so important, I cannot fail to mention the Servant of God Dorothy Day, who founded the Catholic Worker Movement. Her social activism, her passion for justice and for the cause of the oppressed, were inspired by the Gospel, her faith, and the example of the saints. How much progress has been made in this area in so many parts of the world! How much has been done in these first years of the third millennium to raise people out of extreme poverty! I know that you share my conviction that much more still needs to be done, and that in times of crisis and economic hardship a spirit of global solidarity must not be lost. At the same time I would encourage you to keep in mind all those people around us who are trapped in a cycle of poverty. They too need to be given hope. The fight against poverty and hunger must be fought constantly and on many fronts, especially in its causes. I know that many Americans today, as in the past, are working to deal with this problem. It goes without saying that part of this great effort is the creation and distribution of wealth. The right use of natural resources, the proper application of technology and the harnessing of the spirit of enterprise are essential elements of an economy which seeks to be modern, inclusive and sustainable. “Business is a noble vocation, directed to producing wealth and improving the world. It can be a fruitful source of prosperity for the area in which it operates, especially if it sees the creation of jobs as an essential part of its service to the common good” (Laudato Si’, 129). This common good also includes the earth, a central theme of the encyclical which I recently wrote in order to “enter into dialogue with all people about our common home” (ibid., 3). “We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all” (ibid., 14). In Laudato Si’, I call for a courageous and responsible effort to “redirect our steps” (ibid., 61), and to avert the most serious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by human activity. I am convinced that we can make a difference and I have no doubt that the United States – and this Congress – have an important role to play. Now is the time for courageous actions and strategies, aimed at implementing a “culture of care” (ibid., 231) and “an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature” (ibid., 139). “We have the freedom needed to limit and direct technology” (ibid., 112); “to devise intelligent ways of… developing and limiting our power” (ibid., 78); and to put technology “at the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral” (ibid., 112). In this regard, I am confident that America’s outstanding academic and research institutions can make a vital contribution in the years ahead. A century ago, at the beginning of the Great War, which Pope Benedict XV termed a “pointless slaughter”, another notable American was born: the Cistercian monk Thomas Merton. He remains a source of spiritual inspiration and a guide for many people. In his autobiography he wrote: “I came into the world. Free by nature, in the image of God, I was nevertheless the prisoner of my own violence and my own selfishness, in the image of the world into which I was born. That world was the picture of Hell, full of men like myself, loving God, and yet hating him; born to love him, living instead in fear of hopeless self-contradictory hungers”. Merton was above all a man of prayer, a thinker who challenged the certitudes of his time and opened new horizons for souls and for the Church. He was also a man of dialogue, a promoter of peace between peoples and religions. From this perspective of dialogue, I would like to recognize the efforts made in recent months to help overcome historic differences linked to painful episodes of the past. It is my duty to build bridges and to help all men and women, in any way possible, to do the same. When countries which have been at odds resume the path of dialogue – a dialogue which may have been interrupted for the most legitimate of reasons – new opportunities open up for all. This has required, and requires, courage and daring, which is not the same as irresponsibility. A good political leader is one who, with the interests of all in mind, seizes the moment in a spirit of openness and pragmatism. A good political leader always opts to initiate processes rather than possessing spaces (cf. Evangelii Gaudium, 222-223). Being at the service of dialogue and peace also means being truly determined to minimize and, in the long term, to end the many armed conflicts throughout our world. Here we have to ask ourselves: Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society? Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money: money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood. In the face of this shameful and culpable silence, it is our duty to confront the problem and to stop the arms trade. Three sons and a daughter of this land, four individuals and four dreams: Lincoln, liberty; Martin Luther King, liberty in plurality and non-exclusion; Dorothy Day, social justice and the rights of persons; and Thomas Merton, the capacity for dialogue and openness to God. Four representatives of the American people. I will end my visit to your country in Philadelphia, where I will take part in the World Meeting of Families. It is my wish that throughout my visit the family should be a recurrent theme. How essential the family has been to the building of this country! And how worthy it remains of our support and encouragement! Yet I cannot hide my concern for the family, which is threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without. Fundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of marriage and the family. I can only reiterate the importance and, above all, the richness and the beauty of family life. In particular, I would like to call attention to those family members who are the most vulnerable, the young. For many of them, a future filled with countless possibilities beckons, yet so many others seem disoriented and aimless, trapped in a hopeless maze of violence, abuse and despair. Their problems are our problems. We cannot avoid them. We need to face them together, to talk about them and to seek effective solutions rather than getting bogged down in discussions. At the risk of oversimplifying, we might say that we live in a culture which pressures young people not to start a family, because they lack possibilities for the future. Yet this same culture presents others with so many options that they too are dissuaded from starting a family. A nation can be considered great when it defends liberty as Lincoln did, when it fosters a culture which enables people to “dream” of full rights for all their brothers and sisters, as Martin Luther King sought to do; when it strives for justice and the cause of the oppressed, as Dorothy Day did by her tireless work, the fruit of a faith which becomes dialogue and sows peace in the contemplative style of Thomas Merton. In these remarks I have sought to present some of the richness of your cultural heritage, of the spirit of the American people. It is my desire that this spirit continue to develop and grow, so that as many young people as possible can inherit and dwell in a land which has inspired so many people to dream. God bless America!",247,188,0,Republican,54,44,2,Republican,114
Shinzo Abe,Japan,740,4,2015,Prime Minister ,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, distinguished members of the Senate and the House, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: Back in June, 1957, Nobusuke Kishi, my grandfather, standing right here, as Prime Minister of Japan, began his address, by saying, and I quote, It is because of our strong belief in democratic principles and ideals that Japan associates herself with the free nations of the world. Fifty-eight years have passed. Today, I am honored to stand here as the first Japanese Prime Minister ever to address your joint meeting. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to you for inviting me. I have lots of things to tell you. But I am here with no ability, nor the intention, to filibuster. As I stand in front of you today, the names of your distinguished colleagues that Japan welcomed as your ambassadors come back to me: the honorable Mike Mansfield, Walter Mondale, Tom Foley, and Howard Baker. On behalf of the Japanese people, thank you so very, very much for sending us such shining champions of democracy! Ambassador Caroline Kennedy also embodies the tradition of American democracy. Thank you. Thank you for, Ambassador Kennedy, for all the dynamic work you have done for all of us. We all miss Senator Daniel Inouye, who symbolized the honor and achievements of Japanese-Americans. Ladies and gentlemen, my first encounter with America goes back to my days as a student, when I spent a spell in California. A lady named Catherine Del Francia let me live in her house. She was a widow, and always spoke of her late husband saying, “You know, he was much more handsome than Gary Cooper.” She meant it. She really did. In that gallery, you see, my wife, Akie, is there. I don't dare ask what she says about me. Mrs. Del Francia’s Italian cooking was simply out of this world. She was cheerful, and so kind, as to let lots and lots of people stop by at her house. They were so diverse. I was amazed and said to myself, ""America is an awesome country."" Later, I took a job as a steelmaker, and I was given the chance to work in New York. Here in the U.S. rank and hierarchy are neither here nor there. People advance based on merit. When you discuss things you don’t pay much attention to who is junior or senior. You just choose the best idea, no matter who the idea was from. This culture intoxicated me; so much so, after I got elected as a member of the House, some of the old guard in my party would say, ""Hey, you are so cheeky, Abe."" As for my family name, it is not “Eighb.” Some Americans do call me that every now and then, but I don’t take offense. That's because, ladies and gentlemen, the Japanese, ever since they started modernization, have seen the very foundation for democracy in that famous line in the Gettysburg Address. The son of a farmer-carpenter can become the President. The fact that such a country existed woke up the Japanese of the late 19th century to democracy. For Japan, our encounter with America was also our encounter with democracy! And that was more than 150 years ago, giving us a mature history together. Before coming over here, I was at the World War II Memorial. It was a peace -- it was a place of peace and calm that struck me as a sanctuary. The air was filled with the sound of water breaking in the fountains. In one corner stands the Freedom Wall. More than 4,000 gold stars shine on the wall. I gasped with surprise to hear that each star represents the lives of 100 fallen soldiers. I believe those gold stars are a proud symbol of the sacrifices in defending freedom. But in those gold stars, we also find the pain, sorrow, and love for family of young Americans who otherwise would have lived happy lives. Pearl Harbor, Bataan Corregidor, Coral Sea -- the battles engraved at the Memorial crossed my mind, and I reflected upon the lost dreams and lost futures of those young Americans. History is harsh. What is done cannot be undone. With deep repentance in my heart, I stood there in silent prayers for some time. My dear friends, on behalf of Japan and the Japanese people, I offer with profound respect my eternal condolences to the souls of all American people that were lost during World War II. Ladies and gentlemen, in the gallery today is Lieutenant General Lawrence Snowden. Seventy years ago in February, he landed on Iōtō, or the island of Iwo Jima, as a captain in command of a company. In recent years, General Snowden has often participated in the memorial services held jointly by Japan and the U.S. on Iōtō. He said, and I quote, We didn’t and don’t go to Iwo Jima to celebrate victory, but for the solemn purpose to pay tribute to and honor those who lost their lives on both sides. Next to General. Snowden sits Diet Member Yoshitaka Shindo, who is a former member of my Cabinet. His grandfather, General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, whose valor we remember even today, was the commander of the Japanese garrison during the Battle of Iwo Jima. What should we call this, if not a miracle of history? Enemies that had fought each other so fiercely have become friends bonded in spirit. To General Snowden, I pay tribute to your efforts for reconciliation. Thank you so very much. Post war, we started out on our path, bearing in mind feelings of deep remorse over the war. Our actions brought suffering to the people -- peoples in Asian countries. We must not avert our eyes from that. I will uphold the views expressed by the previous prime ministers in this regard. We must all the more contribute in every respect to the development of Asia. We must spare no effort in working for the peace and prosperity of the region. Reminding ourselves of all that, we have come all this way. I am proud of this path we have taken. Seventy years ago, Japan had been reduced to ashes. Then came each and every month from the citizens of the United States gifts to Japan like milk for our children, and warm sweaters, and even goats. Yes, from America, 2,036 goats came to Japan. And it was Japan that received the biggest benefit from the very beginning by the post-war economic system that the U.S. had fostered by opening up its own market and calling for a liberal world economy. Later on, from the 1980s, we saw the rise of the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, the ASEAN countries, and before long, China as well. This time, Japan too devotedly poured in capital and technologies to support their growths. Meanwhile in the U.S., Japan created more employment than any other foreign nation but one, coming second only to the U.K. In this way, prosperity was fostered first by the U.S., and second by Japan. And prosperity is nothing less than the seedbed for peace. Involving countries in Asia-Pacific whose backgrounds vary, the U.S. and Japan must take the lead. We must take the lead to bid -- to build a market -- fair, dynamic, sustainable, and is also free from the arbitrary nations of any -- from the arbitrary intentions of any nation. In the Pacific market, we cannot overlook sweat shops or burdens on the environment. Nor can we simply allow free riders on intellectual property. No. Instead, we can spread our shared values around the world and have them take root: the rule of law, democracy, and freedom. That is exactly what the TPP is all about. Furthermore, the TPP goes far beyond just economic benefits. It is also about our security. Long-term, its strategic value is awesome. We should never forget that. The TPP covers an area that accounts for 40 per cent of our economy, and one third of global trade. We must turn the area into a region for lasting peace and prosperity. That is for the sake of our children and our children's children. As for U.S.-Japan negotiations, the goal is near. Let us bring the TPP to a successful conclusion through our joint leadership. As a matter of fact, I have something I can tell you now. It was about 20 years ago. The GATT negotiations for agriculture were going on. I was much younger, and like a ball of fire, and opposed to opening Japan's agricultural market. I even joined farmers' representatives in a rally in front of the Parliament. However, Japan’s agriculture has gone into decline over these last 20 years. The average age of our farmers has gone up by 10 years now -- and is...now more than 66 years old. Japan's agriculture is at a crossroads. In order for it to survive, it has to change now. We are bringing great reforms toward agriculture policy that's been in place for decades. We are also bringing sweeping reform to our agricultural cooperatives that have not changed in 60 long years. Corporate governance in Japan is now fully in line with global standards, because we made it stronger. Rock-solid regulations are being broken in such sectors as medicine and energy. And I am the spearhead. To turn around our depopulation, I'm determined to do whatever it takes. We are changing some of our old habits to empower women so they can get more actively engaged in all walks of life. In short, Japan is right in the middle of a quantum leap. My dear members of the Congress, please do come and see the new Japan, where we have regained our spirit of reform and our sense of speed. Japan will not run away from any reforms. We keep our eyes only on the road ahead and push forward with structural reform. That's TINA: There Is No Alternative. And there is no doubt about it whatsoever. My dear colleagues, the peace and security of the post-war world was not possible without American leadership. Looking back, it makes me happy all the time that Japan of years past made the right decision. As I told you at the outset, citing my grandfather, the decision -- that decision was to choose a path. That's the path for Japan to ally itself with the U.S., and to go forward as a member of the Western world. In the end, together with the U.S. and other like-minded democracies, we won the Cold War. That's the path that made Japan grow and prosper. And even today, there is no alternative. My dear colleagues, we support the ""rebalancing"" by the U.S. in order to enhance the peace and security of the Asia-Pacific region. And I will state clearly: We will support the U.S. effort first, last, and throughout! Japan has deepened its strategic relations with Australia and India. We are enhancing our cooperation across many fields with the countries of ASEAN and the -- the Republic of Korea. Adding those partners to the central pillar that is the U.S.-Japan alliance, our arrange -- our region will get stable remarkably more. Now, Japan will provide up to 2.8 billion dollars in assistance to help improve U.S. bases in Guam, which will gain strategic significance even more in the future. As regards the state of Asian waters, let me underscore here my three principles. First, states shall make their claims based on international law. Second, they shall not use force or coercion to drive their claims. And third, to settle disputes -- any disputes -- they shall do so by peaceful means. We must make the vast seas stretching from the Pacific to the Indian Oceans seas of peace and freedom, where all follow the rule of law. For that very reason we must fortify the U.S.-Japan alliance. That is our responsibility! Now, let me tell you, in Japan we are working hard to enhance the legislative foundations of our security. Once in place, Japan will be much more able to provide a seamless response for all levels of crisis. These enhanced legislative foundations should make the cooperation between the U.S. military and Japan's Self Defense Forces ever-stronger, and the alliance still more solid, providing credible deterrence for the peace in the region. The reform is the first of its kind and a sweeping one in our post-war history. We will achieve this by this coming summer. Now, I have something to share with you. The day before yesterday Secretaries Kerry and Carter met our Foreign Minister Kishida and Defense Minister Nakatani for consultations. As a result, we now have a new framework, a framework to better put together the forces of the U.S. and Japan, a framework that is in line with the legislative attempts going on in Japan. That is what's necessary to build peace, more reliable peace in the region. And that is namely the new Defense Cooperation Guidelines. Yesterday, President Obama and I fully agreed on the significance of these Guidelines. Ladies and gentlemen, we agreed on a document that is historic! In the early 1990s, in the Persian Gulf, Japan's Self-Defense Forces swept away sea mines. For 10 years in the Indian Ocean, Japanese Self-Defense Forces supported your operation to stop the flow of terrorists and arms. Meanwhile in Cambodia, the Golan Heights, Iraq, Haiti, and South Sudan, members of our Self-Defense Forces provided humanitarian support and peace keeping operations. Their number amounts to 50,000. Based on this track record, we are resolved to take yet more responsibility for the peace and stability in the world. It is for that purpose we are determined to enact all necessary bills by this coming summer. And we will do exactly that. We must make sure human security will be preserved in addition to national security. That's our belief, firm and solid. We must do our best so that every individual gets education, medical support, and an opportunity to rise to be self-reliant. Armed conflicts have always made women suffer the most. In our age, we must realize the kind of world where finally women are free from human rights abuses. Our -- Our servicemen and women have made substantial accomplishments. So have our aid workers who have worked so steadily. Their combined sum has given us a new self-identity. That's why we now hold up high a new banner that is ""proactive contribution to peace based on the principle of international cooperation."" Let me repeat: ""Proactive contribution to peace based on the principle of international cooperation"" should lead Japan along its road for the future. Problems we face include terrorism, infectious diseases, natural disasters, and climate change. The time has come for the U.S.-Japan alliance to face up to and jointly tackle those challenges that are new. After all, our alliance has lasted more than a quarter of the entire history of the United States. It is an alliance that is sturdy, bound in trust and friendship, deep between us. No new concept should ever be necessary for the alliance that connects us, the biggest and the second biggest democratic powers in the free world, in working together! Always, it is an alliance that cherishes our shared values of the rule of law, respect for human rights, and freedom. When I was young in high school and listened to the radio, there was a song that flew out and shook my heart. It was a song by Carol King: When you're down and troubled...close your eyes and think of me...and... I will be there to brighten up even your darkest night. And that day, March 11, 2022, a big quake, a tsunami, and a nuclear accident hit the northeastern part of Japan. The darkest night fell upon Japan. But it was then we saw the U.S. Armed Forces rushing to Japan to the rescue at a scale never seen or heard before. Lots and lots of people from all corners of the U.S. extended the hand of assistance to the children in the disaster areas. Yes, we've ""got a friend"" in you. Together with the victims you shed tears. You gave us something, something, something very, very precious: It was hope, hope for the future. Ladies and gentlemen, the finest asset the U.S. has to give to the world was hope, is hope, will be, and must always be hope! Distinguished representatives of the citizens of the United States, let us call the U.S.-Japan alliance, an alliance of hope. Let the two of us, America and Japan, join our hands together and do our best to make the world a better, a much better, place to live. Alliance of hope -- together, we can make a difference. Thank you so much.",247,188,0,Republican,54,44,2,Republican,114
Mohammad Ashraf Ghani,Islamic Republic of Afghanistan,700,3,2015,President ,"IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE MERCIFUL AND COMPASSIONATE, SPEAKER BOEHNER, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL, HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER MCCARTHY, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER MS. PELOSI, SENATE MINORITY LEADER, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS, PLEASE ALLOW ME TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR GRACIOUS INVITATION TO ADDRESS THIS UNIQUE FORUM OF DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY. ABOVE ALL ELSE, I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES WHOSE GENEROUS SUPPORT FOR MY COUNTRY HAS BEEN SUCH IMMENSE VALUE IN ADVANCING THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM. MORE THAN ONE MILLION BRAVE AMERICANS HAVE SERVED IN AFGHANISTAN. THEY HAVE COME TO KNOW OUR SNOW-CAPPED MOUNTAINS, OUR VALLEYS, OUR WIND-SWEPT DESERTS, OUR PARCHED FIELDS, OUR FLOWING RIVERS AND OUR PLAINS OF WAVING WHEAT, BUT MORE IMPORTANT, KNOWING OUR GENTLEMENOGRAPHY, THEY'VE COME TO DEFEND AND TO KNOW OUR PEOPLE. IN RETURN, THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN RECOGNIZES THE BRAVERY OF YOUR SOLDIERS AND THE TREMENDOUS SACRIFICES THAT AMERICANS HAVE MADE TO KEEP AFGHANISTAN FREE. WE OWE A PROFOUND DEBT TO THE 2,350 SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN KILLED IN THE MORE THAN AND THE MORE THAN 20,000 WHO HAVE BEEN WOUNDED IN SERVICE TO YOUR COUNTRY AND OURS. WE OWE A PROFOUND DEBT TO THE SOLDIERS WHO'VE LOST LIMBS, TO THE BRAVE VETERANS AND TO THE FAMILIES WHO TRAGICALLY LOST THEIR LOVED ONES TO THE ENEMIES' COWARDLY ACTS OF TERROR. WE OWE A PROFOUND DEBT TO THE MANY AMERICANS WHO'VE COME TO REPAIR WELLS AND CURED THE SICK AND WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE WITH APPRECIATION THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S THE ORDINARY AMERICANS WHOSE HARD-EARNED TAXES WHO OVER THE YEARS BUILT THE PARTNERSHIP THAT HAS LED OUR CONVERSATION TODAY. I WANT TO THANK THE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS AND YOU, THEIR REPRESENTATIVES, FOR SUPPORTING US. THE SERVICE OF AMERICAN MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN MADE POSSIBLE BY THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OF THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES. ON BEHALF OF OUR PARLIAMENT AND PEOPLE, I SALUTE AND THANK YOU. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PLEASURE TO RECEIVE THE CONGRESS MEN AND WOMEN DURING YOUR TRIPS TO AFGHANISTAN. PLEASE DO COME AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND IF YOU ARE IN SERVICE, PLEASE COME IN YOUR PROUD UNIFORMS. I HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY THAT WHEN SENATOR GRAHAM WAS JUST AS A COLONEL, I ASKED HIM TO SALUTE -- OUR BRITISH GENERAL AND HE COMPLIED. SO THANK YOU. VETERANS WILL ALWAYS BE WELCOMED IN AFGHANISTAN. OUR DEEPEST HOPE IS THAT THE TIME WILL COME WHEN AMERICANS VISITING OUR COUNTRY, SEE THE CULTURAL HERITAGE AND NATURAL RICHES OF THE VALLEY, THE ANCIENT ARCHITECTURE, THE FISHING STREAMS, THE FORESTS AND THE ANCIENT ARCHITECTURE OF ANOTHER. NOT AS SOLDIERS BUT AS PARENTS SHOWING THEIR CHILDREN THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY WHERE THEY SERVED IN THE WAR THAT DEFEATED TERROR. ON BEHALF OF MY ENTIRE COUNTRY, WHEN THAT DAY COMES YOU'LL BE OUR MOST WELCOMED AND HONORED GUESTS. AMERICA'S SUPPORT TO AFGHANISTAN HAS BEEN LED BY A SUCCESSION OF REMARKABLE GENERALS. I'M PROUD TO HAVE KNOWN AND WORKED WITH DAN MCNEIL, DAVID MCCONCERNON, STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL, DAVID PETRAEUS, JOHN ALLEN, JOSEPH AND JOHN CAMPBELL. THEIR COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION IS INSPIRATIONAL. THESE GENERALS LIVED IN SIMPLE QUARTERS. THEY WORKED TIRELESSLY THROUGH THE NIGHT AND THEIR LEADERSHIP OF THEIR TROOPS SETS AN EXAMPLE THAT OUR GENERALS ARE WORKING HARD TO FOLLOW. YOUR CIVILIAN LEADERS ARE NO LESS INSPIRATIONAL. AMBASSADORS SUCH AS RONALD NEWMAN, RYAN CROCKER, JAMES CUNNINGHAM AND MY GOOD FRIEND, MICHAEL MCKINLEY, GIVE AMERICAN DIPLOMACY FIRST-CLASS LEADERSHIP AND STRATEGIC UNDERSTANDING. AND I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO MENTION THE STIMULATING CONVERSATIONS WITH MY FRIENDS FROM THIS CHAMBER LIKE JOHN MCCAIN, LINDSEY GRAHAM, CARL LEVIN. BUT I MUST ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEEPLY APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTION OF THE AIDE WORKERS WHO ARE DAY-TO-DAY REPRESENTATIVES OF YOUR COUNTRY. I'VE MET PEOPLE FROM ALL 50 STATES OF THE UNION, FROM SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES TO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND COMPUTER OPERATORS. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THEM FOR INTRODUCING THE BEST OF AMERICA TO THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN. FINALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK PRESIDENT OBAMA. HE'S AN ADMIRABLE AND PRINCIPLELED PARTNER. HIS SUPPORT FOR AFGHANISTAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONDITIONAL ON OUR PERFORMANCE. I LIKE AND APPRECIATE HIS CLEAR AND DISCIPLINED APPROACH MAKE AN ENGAGEMENT. THANKS TO HIS RIGOR WE WERE ENCOURAGED TO BUILD UP THE AFGHAN ARMED FORCES INTO THE SELF-RELIANT ARMY IT IS TODAY. BECAUSE HE STOOD FIRM ON THE DEADLINE FOR THE SURGE AND THE TRANSITION THE U.S. ARMY PULLED OUT A LOGISTICAL NEAR MIRACLE. FIRST DEPLOYING THEN WITHDRAWING NEARLY 100,000 SOLDIERS WITHOUT A HITCH. AND IT IS THANKS TO HIS PROMISE TO AMERICA TO END THE ACTIVE COMBAT THAT WE SAW A SEAMLESS HAND OVER THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL COMBAT OPERATIONS FROMURE SIDE TO OURS ON DECEMBER 31, 2014. FROM YOUR SIDE TO OURS ON DECEMBER 31, 2014. U.S. SOLDIERS ARE NO LONGER ENGAGED IN COMBAT. BUT WE ARE DELIGHTED TO HAVE THEM IN THE TRAIN, ASSET, AND ADVICE MISSION. TRAGEDY BROUGHT OUR TWO COUNTRIES TOGETHER, BUT OUR SHARED INTEREST AND VALUES THAT WILL KEEP US TOGETHER. SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 WAS NOT A DISTANT IMAGE THAT I WATCHED ON THE EMOTIONLESS SCREEN OF TELEVISION. IT WAS HORRIFIC AND IT'S PERSONAL. I WAS -- AND IT WAS PERSONAL. I WAS IN MY OFFICE AT THE WORLD BANK WHEN THE FIRST PLANE CRASHED INTO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER AND FOREVER CHANGED THE LIVES OF EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US. NEW YORK IS A SPECIAL PLACE FOR ME AND MY FAMILY. MY WIFE AND I ARE BOTH GRADUATES OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY. I WAS ANOTHER BENEFICIARY OF AMERICANS' WONDERFUL GENEROSITY THAT HAS BUILT SO MANY LONG-STANDING FRIENDSHIPS THROUGHOUT ITS UNIVERSITIES. I ATE CORN BEEF AT NEW YORK'S GREATEST MELTING POT. CLOSE FRIENDS WERE WORKING NEAR THE TRADE CENTER. MY CHILDREN WHO WERE BORN IN NEW YORK AND MY DAUGHTER WAS LIVING IN NEW YORK WHEN THE TWIN TOWERS FELL. I VISITED GROUND ZERO THAT VERY WEEK. SEEING FIRST HAND THE TRAGEDY AND DEVASTATION DROVE HOME THE REALIZATION THAT AFTER 9/11 THE WORLD WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME. I WENT HOME KNOWING THAT AMERICA WOULD SEEK JUSTICE AND I BEGAN TO WRITE THE PLAN FOR OUR NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION. JUSTICE CAME SWIFTLY, AL QAEDA TERRORISTS WERE KILLED OR DRIVEN UNDERGROUND. THE TALIBAN ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR LOSSES AFTER THE INITIAL ENCOUNTERS QUICKLY VACATED THE CITIES WITH THEIR LEADERSHIP MOVING TO PAKISTAN AND THEIR RANK AND FILE RETURNING TO THEIR VILLAGES. THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE ANXIETY ABOUT HOW THE AFGHAN PEOPLE WOULD RESPOND TO THE AMERICAN PRESENCE. THE ISSUE WAS PUT TO REST BY THE WELCOME ACCORDED TO THE AMERICAN SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS AS PARTNER. EVEN TODAY, DESPITE THE THANKFULNESS, THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF AFGHANS CONTINUE TO SEE THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES AS FOUNDATIONAL FOR OUR FUTURE. THERE'S NO BETTER PROOF OF THIS THAN LAST OCTOBER'S OVERWHELMING AND IMMEDIATE PARLIAMENTARYRY APPROVAL OF THE BILATERAL SECURITY AGREEMENT AND STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT, BOTH OF WHICH TESTIFIED TO OUR DESIRE TO CONTINUE THE PARTNERSHIP. AFGHANISTAN HAS BEEN THE FRONTLINE OF THE GLOBAL BATTLE AGAINST EXTREMISM. AMERICA, AS A RESULT, HAS BEEN SAFE, BUT THAT SAFETY HAS BEEN ENSURED THROUGH THE LOSS OF AMERICAN AND AFGHAN LIVES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERROR. WE HAVE MADE GREAT SACRIFICES. BUT THEN IT'S OUR PATRIOTIC TO DO SO. YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVE A CHOICE AND WHEN CAME TO A FORK IN THE ROAD CHOSE TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THANK YOU. MOST RECENTLY DUE TO THE REFUSAL OF THE GOVERNMENT TO SIGN THE BILATERAL SECURITY AGREEMENT AND STATUS FORCES AGREEMENT WITH NATE HEO, WE HAVE LOST MOMENTUM. AND BOTH PARTNERS HAVE TO OPERATE UNDER UNCERTAINTY RESULTING IN SOME EIGHT MONTHS OF LOST TIME IN THE MOST CRITICAL MOMENT OF TRANSITION. YOU COULD HAVE USED THIS OPPORTUNITY TO END THE PARTNERSHIP AND RETURN HOME IN FRUSTRATION, BUT YOU DID NOT. THANKS TO THE FLEXIBILITY SHOWED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA AND CONGRESS, WE HAVE MADE UP FOR THE LOSS AND HAVE REGAINED MOMENTUM. WITHOUT BREAKING BY EVEN THE DAY OF PROMISE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THE COMBAT ROLE WOULD END ON DECEMBER 31, 2014. THANK YOU FOR STAYING. I WOULD LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT OUR PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE IT'S EVOLVING. WE ARE STARTING TO BALANCE THE FOCUS ON SECURITY WITH A NEW EMPHASIS ON RULE OF LAW AND JUSTICE, GROWTH IN THE PURSUIT OF PEACE AND RECONCILIATION. THE FRAMEWORK FOR OUR FUTURE RELATIONSHIP IS DEFINED BY OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT AND THE BILATERAL SECURITY AGREEMENT. ON YOUR SIDE YOU HAVE REAFFIRMED YOUR COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT AFGHANISTAN. ON OUR SIDE, WE WILL FOCUS ON SELF-RELIANCE. TO GET THERE, WE HAVE INITIATED REFORMS THAT WOULD CREATE A SELF-SUSTAINING AFGHANISTAN. I KNOW AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ASKING THE SAME QUESTIONS AS AFGHAN PEOPLE. WILL WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE A SUSTAINED BASIS FOR OUR OPERATION? AND THE ANSWER IS. WITHIN THIS DECADE, WE WILL. AS THE CURRENT FACE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP GROWS TO A CLOSE, OUR APPRECIATION FOR THE DEPTH OF AMERICAN CONTRIBUTION TO OUR PEOPLE CANNOT BE MEASURED IN WORDS ALONE. BUT CAN BE SEEN QUITE LITERALLY IN THE NUMBER OF AFGHANS WHOSE FUTURES HAVE BEEN CHANGED THANKS TO AMERICA AND ITS ALLIES. ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2001, THIS WILL NO LONGER SHOCK YOU, THERE WERE NO GIRLS ENROLLED IN SCHOOL IN AFGHANISTAN. IT WAS ILLEGAL TO EDUCATE GIRLS. TODAY, MORE THAN THREE MILLION GIRLS IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE LEARNING TO OPENLY AND ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE FUTURE OF A DEMOCRATIC AFGHANISTAN. THEIR PARENTS THANK YOU. IN 2002, WHEN THE ALLIES BUILT THEIR FIRST CLINICS, THE AVERAGE LIFE SPAN OF WHOLE OF AFGHAN WAS 4 YEARS. TODAY, TODAY IT'S OVER 60. THEIR CHILDREN THANK YOU. TODAY THE RATE OF MATERNAL MORE TALITY IN OUR POOR COUNTRY WAS UNACCEPTABLY HIGH, BUT THANKS TO THE IMMENSE EFFORT YOU HAVE MADE TO BUILD CLINICS AND TRAIN NURSES, AN AFGHAN WOMAN NO LONGER -- IS NO LONGER MORE LIKELY TO DIE BECAUSE SHE GIVES BIRTH TO A CHILD THAN IF SHE HAD BEEN SOMEWHAT CAUGHT ON THE FRONTLINE OF COMBAT. THEIR HUSBANDS AND THEIR CHILDREN THANK YOU. OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH AMERICA AND ITS ALLIES HAS BROUGHT OILER COUNTRY HOPE WHERE WE -- OUR COUNTRY HOPE WHERE WE HAD NONE. WE WOULD ONCE AGAIN LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THAT WONDERFUL GIFT FROM YOUR PEOPLE TO OURS. THE GIFT OF HOPE. BUT IN AFGHANISTAN, THERE'S A SAYING THAT NO GIFT CAN REMAIN UNRECIPROCATED. TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN THAT GIFT OF REBORN HOPE BY OFFERING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE A PARTNERSHIP WITH A NATION THAT IS COMMITTED TO THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM AND THAT WILL JOIN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE GROWING THREAT OF TERRORISM. I WILL USE MY REMARKS TODAY TO TELL AMERICA THE HISTORY OF HOW A FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN CAME TO BE. IT IS A STORY ABOUT HOW A POOR COUNTRY THAT RELIED ON FOREIGN HELP BECAME A SELF-RELIANT NATION WHERE FREE TRADE AND THE RULE OF LAW CREATE JOBS AND PROSPERITY FOR ITS PEOPLE. IT IS ALSO A STORY ABOUT HOW A COUNTRY THAT HAS BEEN RAVAGED BECAME A PLATFORM FOR PEACE AND REGIONAL STABILITY AND PROSPERITY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE STORY OF AFGHANISTAN'S PATH TO SELF-RELIANCE IS ALREADY STARTED. IT BEGAN WITH LAST YEAR'S ELECTION AND THE FORMATION OF OUR NATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT. AFGHANISTAN'S EXTERNAL IMAGE IS OF A TRADITIONAL COUNTRY THAT HAS BEEN FROZEN IN TIME. THAT MY PARTNER OF DR. ABDULLAH, INTENSE AND COMPASSIONATE CAMPAIGNS ON THE MOST MODERN OFFICIALS. THAT IS THE NEED TO END CORRUPTION. TAKING THE ACTION THAT IS WILL BUILD TRANSPARENCY INTO GOVERNMENT AND GUARANTEEING SUPPORT FOR THE IMPARTIAL RULE OF LAW. CAMPAIGNS BECAME FORUMS FOR PUBLIC DEBATE, IN THE FINAL ELECTION, NOT ONLY MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION AFGHANS TURNED OUT TO THE POLLS, BUT MORE THAN 38% OF THE VOTES WERE CAST BY WOMEN. 90 OF THEM WOULD NEVER HAVE PREVIOUSLY HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK POLITICALLY WITH THEIR OWN CHOICE. THERE'S NO DENYING THAT THE ELECTION WAS HARD FOUGHT, BUT IN THE END WE CHOSE THE POLITICS OF UNITY OVER THE POLITICS OF DIVISION. THE NATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT BRINGS TOGETHER ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TO MAKE THE GOVERNMENT WHERE DISPUTES -- AN ARENA WHERE DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED. DR. ABDULLAH AND MYSELF MAY NOT INITIALLY AGREE ON EVERY ISSUE, BUT WE BOTH BELIEVE DEEPLY THAT SPIRITED DEBATE WILL PRODUCE BETTER OUTCOMES THAN WILL CONFRONTATIONAL STALEMATE. WE NOT ONLY WORK TOGETHER, WE LIKE WORKING WELL TOGETHER. AFGHANISTAN COUNTRY PERCEPTION IS WHAT'S SUITED TO DEMOCRACY. LIKE AMERICANS, AFGHANS ARE INDIVIDUALS, NONE OF US DEFERS TO ANYONE ELSE. WE -- PERSUADING EACH OTHER IS AN ART FORM. OUR KEY CHARACTERISTICS ARE OUR OPENNESS AND HOSPITALITY. WE BELIEVE IN EQUALITY. EVEN IF THE MOST TRADITIONAL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, OUR LEADERSHIP MUST EARN RATHER THAN INHERIT THEIR POSITION. THERE IS A STRONG PUBLIC CONSCIENCE. PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED TO ACT FOR THE COMMON GOOD. WE LOVE DEBATE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE YOU TO AFGHANISTAN. WE ARE AN OLD COUNTRY WITH A PROUD HERITAGE AND A HISTORY OF TRADE WITH OUR NEIGHBORS. WE HAVE HAD EXCHANGE FOR AT LEAST 2,000 YEARS. AND OUR WOMEN COULD WRITE 2 1/2 THOUSAND YEARS AGO. FOR AT LEAST THREE MILLENNIA, WE HAVE THE CARAVANS AND TRADE FOLKS THAT SPREAD ACROSS ASIA BRINGING CHINESE SILK AND INDIAN TEXTILES TO AND SHEN ROME AND RENAISSANCE ITALY. THE 19TH CENTURY DISRUPTED THIS WORLD AS IT DID IN SO MANY OTHER PLACES. AFGHANISTAN BECAME AN ISOLATED BUFFER, CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO EXPANDING EMPIRES. THE EMERGENCE OF THE SOVIET UNION FURTHER ISOLATED OUR COUNTRY, CULMINATING IN THE 1979 INVASION AND THE SUBSEQUENT WAR OF RESISTANCE. . TODAY, HOWEVER, THE ISOLATION IS OVER. FIRST, AWARENESS IS GROWING, AFGHANISTAN IS QUITE LITERALLY THE HEART OF ASIA. ASIA CANNOT BECOME A CONTINENTAL ECONOMY WITHOUT US. ASIA IN THE NEXT 25 YEARS WILL HAVE THE 1869 MOMENT, THE EAST AND WEST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES WERE JOINED THROUGH THE TRANSCONTINENTAL BUT THIS NEW INTERCONNECTED ASIA CANNOT HAPPEN WITHOUT US. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF 3. 5 BILLION PEOPLE AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPORT SOMETHING AND NOT JUST IMPORT. OUR FRAGMENTED GEING A RAFFY CAN ONCE BEGIN BECOME THE OPPORTUNITY FOR INTEGRATING CENTRAL, WEST, EAST AND SOUTH ASIA INTO A NETWORK THAT SUPPORTS STABILITY AND PROSPERITY OVER A VAST SWATH OF SERVICE. DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS CROSS-BORDER TRADE AND SUPPORT, MULTICOUNTRY INVESTMENTS IN ENERGY, TRANSPORT AND WATER. AND THIS AGAIN IS BEGINNING. THE FIRST MAJOR PROJECT BETWEEN CENTRAL ASIA AND SOUTH ASIA FOR TRANSMITTING ENERGY IS ALREADY UNDER WAY. AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS BACKED BY THE LEADERS OF OUR COUNTRIES WAS BUILT, THE PEACE AND PROSPERITY FOR SOUTH AND CENTRAL ASIA IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE COMMON MARKET HAS DONE SO FOR EUROPE AND AFGHANISTAN HAS DONE FOR OUR NEIGHBORING REGION TO THE EAST. WE ENVISION AFGHANISTAN THAT WITHIN 20 YEARS IT'S BECOME A HUB OF TRADE IN GAS PIPELINES, POWER TRANSMISSION LINES, RAILWAYS, MODERN TELECOM AND BANKING SERVICES. AMERICAN SUPPORT FOR ALL OF THESE IS ESSENTIAL AND WE THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMITMENT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF ONE STORY OF OUR FUTURE HISTORY IS BRIGHT, THERE IS ANOTHER DARKER CLOUD THAT IS MAKING ITS WAY TOWARDS OUR COUNTRY. AFGHANISTAN'S SECURITY TRANSITION TOOK PLACE AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE UNEXPECTED RISE OF RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THE PROMISE OF THE ARAB SPRING GAVE WAY TO THE EMERGENCE OF DASH TERROR AND COLLAPSE OF STATE. BUT THE CHANGE ECOLOGY OF TERROR COULD HAVE NOT FORMED WITHOUT SOME STATES TOLERATING, FINANCING, PROVIDING SANCTUARY AND USING VIOLENT, NONSTATE ACTORS AS INSTRUMENTS OF SHORTSIGHTED POLICIES. IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE WORLD UNDERSTAND THE TERRIBLE THREAT THAT THEY POSE TO THE STATES OF WESTERN AND CENTRAL ASIA. TERRORIST MOVEMENTS WHOSE GOAL TO DESTABILIZE EVERY STATE IN THE REGION ARE LOOKING FOR NEW BASES OF OPERATION. WE'RE THE FRONT LINE. BUT TERRORISTS NEITHER RECOGNIZE BOUNDARIES MORE REQUIRE PASSPORTS TO SPREAD THEIR MESSAGE OF HATE AND DISCORD. FROM THE WEST, THE DASH IS ALREADY SENDING ADVANCED GUARDS TO SOUTHERN WESTERN AFGHANISTAN. WITHOUT PAKISTAN'S COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATIONS IN WHICH MORE THAN 40,000 PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY DIED ARE PUSHING THE TALIBAN TOWARDS AFGHANISTAN'S BORDER REGION. CULL MINUTIZATION OF THE ECONOMY IS PART OF THIS NEW ECOLOGY OF TERROR. CONTROL OVER THE NARCOTICS TRADE IS PROOF PROVIDING THE FINANCING OF THESE GROUPS TO FIND WEAPONS. BLURRING THE LINES BETWEEN CRIMINAL ECONOMICS AND CRIMINAL POLITICS. EACH OF THESE GROUPS POSES A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER TO OUR NEIGHBORS, TO THE ARAB ISLAMIC WORLD AND TO THE WORLD AT LARGE. AFGHANISTAN IS CARRYING FORWARD EVERYONE'S FIGHT BY CONTAINING THIS THREAT. BUT EXTREMISM IS BECOMING A SYSTEM, ONE, THAT LIKE A DANGEROUS VIRUS, IS CONSTANTLY MUTATING, BECOMING MORE LETHAL, WELL-FINANCED AND THRIVING ON WEAKNESS AND AN OVERALL LACK OF REGIONAL COORDINATION. TO DATE, AFGHANISTAN'S PEOPLE HAVE REJECTED THE VIOLENT MOVEMENT. WE ARE WILLING TO SPEAK TRUTH ABOUT TERROR. MILITARY FIGHTING MAY STEM THE ADVANCE OF EXTREMISM BUT IT WILL NOT PUT AN END TO THE ANGER AND HATRED BEING PROMULGATED ACROSS MAJORITY COUNTRIES FROM THESE GROUPS. THAT HATE MUSTING CHAPPED AND OVERCOME FROM WITHIN THE RELIGION OF ISLAM. DD THAT HATE MUST BE CHALLENGED AND OVERCOME FROM WITHIN THE RELIGION OF ISLAM. WHO IS ENTITLED TO SPEAK FOR ISLAM? LEADERS, INTELLECTUALS AND THOSE MANY MILLIONS OF MUSLIMS WHO BELIEVE THAT ISLAM IS A RELIGION OF TOLERANCE AND VIRTUE MUST FIND THEIR VOICE. SILENCE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. BUT SILENCE IS NOT WHAT THE WORLD WILL HEAR FROM US. AFGHANISTAN IS JOINING A NEW CONSENSUS THAT'S EMERGING IN THE MUSLIM WORLD, A CONSENSUS THAT REJECTS INTOLERANCE, EXTREMISM AND WAR. THEY HAVE DOCUMENTED BEAUTIFULLY CENTRAL ASIA'S LONG TRADITION OF RATIONALISM AND SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY. DURING ISLAMEST GOLDEN AGE, THEY RECORDED ALL KNOWN KNOWLEDGE OF THE MEDIEVAL WORD GIVING THE WORD, ADVANCES IN ALGENTLEMAN BRA, ASTRONOMY, WATER RESOURCE MANAGING, PRINTING. THIS IS THE ISLAMIC CIVILIZATION THAT NEEDS TO REINVENT ITSELF. THE ISLAMIC WORLD MUST UNDERSTAND ITS OWN GLORIOUSLY TOLERANT AND INQUIZ TIFF PAST. IT MUST RE-ENGAGE WITH THE WORLD OPENLY AND WITHOUT PARANOIA. WE, THE UNITY GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN, KNOW THAT ISLAM IS A RELIGION OF PEACE. WE ARE RESPONDING TO EXTREMIST THREATS BY BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS IN THE GLOBAL, REGIONAL, ISLAMIC AND NATIONAL LEVELS. AFGHANISTAN ABIDES BY NATIONAL CONVENTION AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS FIRMLY EMBEDDED IN OUR CONSTITUTION. TO ACHIEVE THESE RIGHTS FOR OUR CITIZENS, WE'RE COMMITTED TO SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND I'M PLEASED THAT A TIRELESS CHAMPION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS A MEMBER OF THIS DELEGATION AND IS TODAY SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE OF THIS GREAT CHAMBER. AND OUR GOVERNMENT WILL JOIN THE FREE TRADE SYSTEM AND HARRONIZE INVESTMENT RULES THAT BUILD PROSPERITY -- HARMONIZE INVESTMENT RULES AND BUILDING PROSPERITY. WE ARE ENGAGING PEOPLE ACROSS ASIA FOR TRADE. A VAST REGION THAT EXTENDS FROM INDIA TO BEYOND. WE ARE MAKING A HEADWAY IN THE CORRIDOR THAT WILL LINK US TO GEORGIA, TURKEY AND EUROPE INTO REALITY AND THANK YOU, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, FOR -- THE ARAB ISLAMIC WORLD, FROM THE SAUDI ARABIA, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, IS KEENLY AWARE OF THE NEW THREATS AND WE HOPE THEY WILL SOON AGREE ON A FRAMEWORK OF COOPERATION. THE RECENT DECLARATION OF A COUNCIL ACROSS THE MUSLIM WORLD MAY WELL BE AN HISTORIC TURNING POINT IN BUILDING THAT ALLIANCE. CONDEMNATION OF TERROR BY THIS LARGEST GATHERING OF MUSLIM IS AN UNPRECEDENTED STEP AND IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE SHORTCOMINGS OF MUSLIM MAJORITY COUNTRY GOVERNMENTS. PROPERLY SUPPORTED, AFGHANISTAN IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO BLOCK THE SPREAD OF EXTREMISM. WE HAVE NONE OF THE HISTORICAL COMPLEXES THAT CHOOSE RESENTMENT ACROSS WESTERN DOMINATION. AFTER ALL, WE DEFEATED MOST OF THE EMPIRES. WITH THE BARE EXCEPTION OF THE TALIBAN REGIME, ISLAM HAS BEEN INCLUSIVE AND REFLECTIVE, NOT VIOLENT AND ANGRY. AND AFTER 36 YEARS OF CONFLICT, OUR PEOPLE ARE WELL VACCINATED AGAINST THE SEDUCTION OF IDEOLOGICALLY BASED -- OUR PEOPLE, OUR CHILDREN DESPERATELY WANT TO BE KNOWN. ORDINARY IS WHAT HAS ESCAPED US AND WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO BE LEADING ORDINARY LIVES. TO GO TO SCHOOL AND TO COME BACK. TO SHOP WITHOUT BEING BLOWN UP. TO PLAY VOLLEYBALL WITHOUT BEING ATTACKED. SO MANY CHILDREN I HAVE HELD IN MY ARMS HAVE BEEN MUTILATED. THAT MUST NOT BE PERMITTED AND CANNOT BE PERMITTED AND WILL NOT BE PERMITTED. FOR AFGHANISTAN TO OPPOSE THE VIOLENCE OF EXTREMISTS WE MUST TURN OUR SIGHTS TO THE STRUGGLE TO END THE CONDITION THAT GIVES RISE TO EXTREMISM IN THE FIRST PLACE. OUR EFFORTS BEGINS WITH A FRANK RECOGNITION OF OUR PROBLEMS AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE MUST TACKLE WITH DETERMINATION AND COMMITMENT. NEARLY 40 YEARS OF CONFLICT IS PRODUCED A COUNTRY WHERE CORRUPTION PERMEATES OUR GOVERNMENT. UNTIL WE ROOT OUT THIS CANCER, OUR GOVERNMENT WILL NEVER GENERATE THE TRUST TO WIN HEARTS OF OUR PEOPLE OR THE TRUST OF YOUR TAXPAYERS. WE WILL ELIMINATE CORRUPTION. ON OUR SECOND DAY IN OFFICE WE TACKLED THE NOTORIOUS CASE OF KABUL BANK WHICH FOR YEARS -- I'M PLEASED TO REPORT TO YOU THAT ALL THE COURT SYSTEMS OF AFGHANISTAN, INCLUDING THE SUPREME COURT, HAS NOW MADE A DECISION AGAINST THESE THIEVES AND HAVE ALLOWED TO COLLECT FROM THEM AND GET THE PUBLIC PURSE REFILLED. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ENDING CORRUPTION AND IMPUNITY ARE THE PRECURSORS OF SELF-RELIANCE, BUT THE TRUE TEST WILL BE WHETHER WE CAN RESTORE THE FISCAL BASIS OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE. WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT NATURAL RESOURCES AND CRITICAL MARKET LINKING, INFRASTRUCTURE, DEVELOPMENT PROVIDE OUR YOUTH WITH JOBS, HELP US BALANCE THE BUDGET AND LAUNCH THE VIRTUOUS CYCLE. HERE I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT WE ARE REVERSING DECADES OF MISMANAGEMENT. WE HAVE JUST REACHED AGREEMENT WITH I.M.F. BUT MORE SIGNIFICANTLY WE ARE DETERMINED TO CREATE THE WEALTH THAT WOULD NOT MAKE US DEPENDENT. DURING THIS DECADE, WE CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO PAY BOTH FOR OUR SECURITY AND DELIVERY OF SERVICES. ECONOMIC GROWTH IS THE FIRST FOUNDATION BLOCK OF SELF-RELIANCE. THE SECOND FOUNDATION IS WITH THE EDUCATIONAL OF AFGHANISTAN'S WOMAN. NO COUNTRY IN THE MODERN WORLD CAN BE SELF-RELIANT WITH HALF OF ITS POPULATION LOCKED AWAY. UNEDUCATED AND UNABLE TO CONTRIBUTE ENERGY, CREATIVITY AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE A TRADITION OF RESPECTING WOMEN AND LET US TO THE FORGET THE LARGEST TRADER WAS THE WIFE OF THE PROPHET. AND THE GREATER TRANSMITTER OF COLLEGE, IT WAS THE SECOND WIFE OF THE PROPHET. CUSTOMS DO NOT REPLACE THE FUNDAMENTAL SENSE OF JUSTICE BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN THAT SOCIETIES THAT SEEK FAIRNESS ARE BUILT UPON. AFGHAN CULTURE TRADITION FOR WOMEN AS LEADERS, MANAGERS, AND TRADERS. THE GENDER APARTHEID IMPOSED BY THE TALIBAN CAME FROM PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF FAMILIES IN REFUGEE CAMPS AND VILLAGES BOARDING SCHOOLS. OUR PLAN FOR RESTORING WOMAN'S PLACE IN SOCIETY IS BUILT ON THREE PILLARS. THAT RESTS ON A FOUNDATION OF RESPECT FOR THE HUMAN, RELIGIOUS, AND CONSTITUTION PRICE OF ALL OUR CITIZENS. FIRST, AND I WANT TO SPEND A LITTLE TIME ON THIS THEME, EDUCATING WOMAN IS NOT SOLELY A MATTER OF RIGHT, IMPORTANT THOUGH THEY ARE. IT IS A MATTER OF NATIONAL NECESSITY. I SAID IN THE PAST THAT EDUCATING ONE OF A YOUNG GIRL WILL CHANGE THE NEXT FIVE GENERATION OF A FAMILY. I WOULD NOT BE STANDING BEFORE YOU TODAY AS AN EDUCATED MOON IF MY GRANDMOTHER, AN EXILE IN INDIA, COULD LEARN TO READ UNDER THE BRITISH NOT TAKEN IT UPON HERSELF TO MAKE SURE THAT I WOULD MATCH MY YOUTHFUL PASSION FOR HUNTING AND RIDING HORSES WITH MASTERS THE CLASSICS AND STRIVING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES. THANK YOU, GRANDMOTHER. AFGHANISTAN'S SELF-RELIANCE ALIGNS MEN AND WOMAN WHO CAN RUN A MODERN ECONOMY. BASIC HEALTH AND EDUCATION MUST REACH ALL OUR YOUNG GIRLS. THAT'S A PROMISE. BUT BEYOND PROVIDING ALL OUR YOUNG GIRLS WITH THESE BASIC RIGHTS, WE'LL INCREASE TO PARITY, THE NUMBER OF WOMAN GRADUATE INTERESTING HIGH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. EVEN AS I TALK TO YOU, TODAY IN KABUL THE SIGNS ARE ALREADY BEING FINISHED FOR AN ALL WOMAN'S UNIVERSITY THAT WILL PROVIDE SAFE, TOP QUALITY EDUCATION FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF AFGHAN WOMAN LEADER. LET ME TELL YOU THE STORY OF A YOUNG WOMAN FROM KANDAHAR. HER SCHOOLING BEGAN WHEN SHE BREAKS THREAD OF THE CYCLE BY PEOPLE SWEARING THAT THEY WILL THROW ACID IN HER FACE BEFORE THEY WOULD LET A GIRL ATTEND A SCHOOL. SHE WOULD NOT BE DISSUADED. HER UNCLE THREATENED TO DISOWN HER WHEN SHE APPLIED TO UNIVERSITY, BUT SHE STARED HIM DOWN. SHE WENT TO AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF AFGHANISTAN WHERE SHE NOT ONLY TOP OF HAD HER CLASS BUT AIDED BY A FULBRIGHT SCHOLARSHIP WENT ON TO GET A MASTER'S DEGREE FROM THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY. TODAY, FORMERERLY HER UNCLE IS SO PROUD OF HER THAT HE TELL HIS GRANDCHILDREN, BOTH LITTLE BOYS AND LITTLE GIRLS, THEY MUST BE AS BRAVE AS THEIR MOTHER. LIKE THOUSANDS OF AFGHAN WOMEN THANKS AMERICA FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. FROM THE PRIMARY SCHOOLTEACHERS, UNIVERSITY IN KABUL, FOR THE SCHOLARSHIP TO OHIO. THAT CHANGED HER LIFE AND HER CHILDREN'S FUTURE. SHE HAS EDUCATED -- SHE IS DEDICATED TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MILLIONS OF AFGHAN WOMEN. THE SECOND PILLAR IS THAT WOMAN MUST HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TAKING ON THE OPPORTUNITIES AS MAN. WOMAN'S FULL EMPOWERMENT WILL COME ABOUT NOT THROUGH GLOBAL CONVENTIONS OR GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS BUT WHEN THEY OWN JOBS AND BUSINESSES. THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN A STEADFAST SUPPORTER OF THE NATIONWIDE NATIONAL SOLIDARITY PROGRAM WHICH FOR 10 YEARS HAS GIVEN NOT THOUSANDS BUT MILLIONS OF POOR VILLAGE WOMEN THEIR FIRST CHANCE TO HAVE THEIR OWN RESOURCE. OUR THIRD AND FINAL FOUNDATIONAL BELIEF IS THAT A MENTAL AND CULTURAL REVOLUTION MUST TAKE PLACE OVER TREATMENT OF WOMEN AND BY OUR SOCIETY. INTEREST'S NO POINT TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH WE RESPECT WOMAN'S HONOR IF WE LET THREAT GO UNPUNISHED OR ALLOW HARASSMENT IN OUR STREET. WE HAVE SIGNED THE GLOBAL CONVENTIONS TO END VIOLENCE AND DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMAN. WE WILL IMPLEMENT THEM VIGOROUSLY, BUT WORK IS STILL NEEDED TO CONVINCE OUR PEOPLE THAT THE PROTECTION OF WOMAN'S RIGHT IS PART AND PARCEL OF THEIR OWN QUEST FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE. I PERSONALLY AS THE LEADER OF AFGHANISTAN AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE ACTIVISTS AND LEADERS EVER OUR COUNTRY TO BRING ABOUT THIS MENTAL CHANGE. BOTH DR. ABDULLAH AND I WILL INSIST THAT THE OFFICIALS OF OUR GOVERNMENT HAVE NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR WORKPLACE FAIRNESS. THANKS TO YOUR HELP AND SUPPORT, THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN ARE INDEED CHANGING. I'M SURE THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN THOSE VIDEOS OF FATHERS PROUDLY TAKING THEIR SHINY EYED DAUGHTERS TO SHOW OFF THEIR NEWFOUND SKILLS IN THE ANCIENT PART OF SKATEBOARDING. THEY ARE BUT A FEW OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE UNDER WAY AND MUST BE PROTECTED. I AM MEETING FREQUENTLY WOMEN WHO ARE ENTERTAINING IDEA, SERIOUSLY IDEA OF BECOMING THE FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN AND WE WILL SUPPORT THEM. I AM PLEASED TO STATE THAT WE FULFILLED OUR PROMISE TO NAME FOUR WOMEN TO THE AFGHAN CABINET. RAISING THE WOMAN SHARE TO 20%, STILL TOO LOW, BUT AT LEAST OUR PROMISE, WE ARE DETERMINED TO NAME QUALIFIED WOMAN TO AMBASSADORS AND INCREASE THEIR NUMBER AS DEPUTY MINISTERS, AND WE ARE WORKING HARD TO ATTRACT AND TRADE OUR WHOLE NEW CADRE OF WOMAN INTO OUR GOVERNMENT. I PROMISE YOU YEARS FROM NOW OUR MINISTRY WILL HAVE A WHOLE NEW ELECTORATE WITH WOMAN IN LEADING POSITION. WE ARE A COUNTRY OF YOUNG PEOPLE. THE ABSOLUTE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE UNDER 30 YEARS OF AGE. YOU ARE INVESTED IN THE FUTURE NOT IN REPEATING THE PAST. JOBS AND ENGAGEMENT WITH THE WORLD ARE THEIR FIRST PRIORITY. DESPITE ALL OF THE ASSISTANCE AFGHANISTAN HAS RECEIVED OVER THE YEARS, 30% OF THE POPULATION STILL LIVES BELOW THE POVERTY LINE. LACKING EVEN BASIC SERVICES SUCH AS CLEAN WATER OR HOUSEHOLD ELECTRICITY. THIS CANNOT CONTINUE. WE HAVE ARTICULATED A CHARTER THAT WILL FIND INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NEEDED TO REDUCE POVERTY ACROSS THE NATION AND PREPARE THE NEXT GENERATION FOR CAPSULIZING ON THE NEW OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE THRIVING ECONOMY CAN PROVIDE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SO FAR I HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE WILL ACHIEVE SELF-RELIANCE BY ENDING CORRUPTION, BALANCING THE BUDGET, MOBILIZING THE ENERGIES OF WOMAN AND UTAH, AND GROWING THE ECONOMY. LET ME NOW TURN TO THE ELEPHANT THAT IS LACKING IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM. WE MUST SECURE PEACE. AFGHANS HAVE SHOWN THAT WE KNOW HOW TO FIGHT. UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE INHERITED THAT SKILL FOR THREE PL YEAR. SINCE AS FAR BACK AS INVASION OF ALEXANDERER AND THE MORE MODERN EXPULSION OF THE SOVIET UNION AFGHANS HAVE SHOWN THAT YOU'LL PROTECT OUR COUNTRY AGAINST FOREIGN ATTACKS NO MATTER HOW STEEP THE PRICE OR HOW WELL ARMED THE INTRUDER. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT PROVIDED THAT THEY CONTINUE TO RECEIVE EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING OUR FORMED FORCES WILL STAND FIRM AGAINST ANY EFFORT BY OUTSIDE EXTREMISTS TO BUILD A BASE INSIDE. BUT WE MUST NOW SHOW THAT WE CAN ALSO BRING PEACE. OUR STRATEGY IS BUILT AROUND THREE ISSUES. THE FIRST IS DIMCY TO BUILD A COMMUNCHTE OF NATIONS. WE HAVE MET WITH THE LEADERS OF PAKISTAN, INDIA, TURKMENISTAN, EMIRATE, AND CHINA, AMONG OTHERS. THEIR COMMITMENT FOR BUILDING MUTUAL SECURITY ACROSS NATION INCLUDES ENDING THE FINANCING AND SANCTUARY FOR EXTREMIST GROUPS. THE SECOND INITIATIVE IS TO BUILD UP THE ABILITY OF OUR ARMED FORCES TO PROJECT THEIR ELECTED GOVERNMENT ACROSS OUR ENTIRE NATIONAL TERRITORY. OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES NOW TRANSFORMED INTO THE RESOLUTE SUPPORT MISSION HAS GIVEN AFGHANISTAN A WELL TRAINED ARMY THAT IS TAKING THE FIGHT TO THE ENEMY. WE ARE NO LONGER ON THE DEFENSIVE. ON DECEMBER 31, 2014, ALL COMBAT OPERATIONS WERE ENDED AND TURNED OVER TO AFGHAN SECURITY FORCES. GENERAL CAMPBELL, HAS PUBLICLY TESTIFIED IN THIS VERY CHAMBER THAT THE AFGHAN ARMY'S PROFESSIONALISM AND MORALE MEET ALL OF THE MILITARY MAN'S EXPECTATION. WE WILL MEET THE TALIBAN FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH NOT WEAKNESS SO THAT THE HARD PART, GAINS IN EDUCATION, HEALTH, GOVERNMENT, FREEDOM AND WOMAN'S RIGHTS ARE NOT LOST. THE THIRD INITIATIVE WILL BE OUR PUSH FOR NATIONAL RECONCILIATION. THE TALIBAN NEED TO CHOOSE NOT TO BE AL QAEDA. AND IF THEY CHOOSE TO BE AFGHAN, THEY WILL BE WELCOMED TO BE PART OF THE FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY. MANY BELIEVE THEMSELVES TO BE PATRIOTS AGAINST THE CORRUPTION AND CRIMINALITY THAT THEY SAW IN THEIR TOWNS AND VILLAGES. WE CAN DEAL WITH GRIEVANCES, PROVIDED THAT COMPETENCE AGREE TO RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION AND THE RULE OF LAWS AS THE OUTCOMES OF NEGOTIATIONS WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN FIND A PATH. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT AN OVERNIGHT TRANSFORMATION OF MY COUNTRY. YOU'RE TOO WISE FOR SUCH STORIES. 12 YEARS OF PARTNERSHIP PROVIDE EVIDENCE ENOUGH THAT THE ROAD AHEAD WILL BE DIFFICULT. WE LIVE IN A ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD. WE ARE A VERY POOR COUNTRY. SELF-RELIANCE IS OUR GOAL. WE BEAR THE SCARS OF THE FIGHT AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION. SCARS THAT ARE IN OUR MINDS AS ON THE BODIES OF THE AFGHAN FARMERS AND AMERICAN SOLDIERS WHO HAVE FOUGHT FOR FREEDOM. BUT ALTHOUGH WE MAY BE POOR, WE ARE VERY PROUD. OUR GOAL OF SELF-RELIANCE IS NO PIPE DREAM TO PACIFY PARTNERS WHO ARE TIRED OF HEARING THE PROMISES THAT WE FAILED TO MEET. WE WANT YOUR KNOW HOW, THE BUSINESS SKILLS OF YOUR CORPORATIONS, THE INNOVATION OF YOUR START-UPS, AND THE COMMITMENT, BUT WE DON'T WANT YOUR CHARITY. WE HAVE NO MORE INTEREST IN PERPETUATING A CHILDISH DEPENDENCE THAN YOU HAVE IN BEING SADDLED WITH A POOR FAMILY MEMBER WHO LACKS THE ENERGY AND DRIVE TO GET OUT AND FIND A JOB. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE THE LAZY UNCLE JOE. AFGHANISTAN CAN AND WILL BE AN ENDURING SUCCESS. YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR UNDERSTANDING, AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO OUR COUNTRY WILL NOT HAVE BEEN IN VAIN. AFGHANISTAN WILL BE THE GRAVEYARD OF AL QAEDA AND THEIR FOREIGN TERRORIST ASSOCIATES. NEVER AGAIN WILL OUR COUNTRY BE HOSTS TO TERRORISTS. NEVER AGAIN WILL WE GIVE EXTREMISTS THE SANTH SANCTUARY TO BE THEIR DESTRUCTIVE PLOTS. WE WILL BE THE PLATFORM FOR THE PEACEFUL COOPERATION OF OUR CIVILIZATION. TOGETHER OUR TWO COUNTRIES WILL FINISH THE JOB THAT BEGAN ON THAT CLEAR, TERRIBLE SEPTEMBER MORNING ALMOST 14 YEARS AGO. WE HAVE THE WILL AND WE HAVE THE COMMITMENT THAT WILL ANCHOR OUR COUNTRY AND THE WORLD COMMUNITY OF PEACEFUL DEMOCRATIC NATIONS. KNOWING OUR CONDITION, YOU, THE AMERICAN CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WILL DECIDE HOW TO ENSURE THAT OUR COMMON GOALS AND INTERESTS ARE WRITTEN INTO THE BOOKS THAT WILL BE TELLING THE HISTORY OF OUR SHARED FUTURE. THANK YOU, AGAIN, AND MAY GOD BLESS THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN AMERICA AND AFGHANISTAN.",247,188,0,Republican,54,44,2,Republican,114
Binyamin Netanyahu,State of Israel ,666,3,2015,Prime Minister,"Speaker of the House John Boehner, President Pro Tem Senator Orrin Hatch, Senator Minority -- Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. I also want to acknowledge Senator, Democratic Leader Harry Reid. Harry, it's good to see you back on your feet. I guess it's true what they say, you can't keep a good man down. My friends, I'm deeply humbled by the opportunity to speak for a third time before the most important legislative body in the world, the U.S. Congress. I want to thank you all for being here today. I know that my speech has been the subject of much controversy. I deeply regret that some perceive my being here as political. That was never my intention. I want to thank you, Democrats and Republicans, for your common support for Israel, year after year, decade after decade. I know that no matter on which side of the aisle you sit, you stand with Israel. The remarkable alliance between Israel and the United States has always been above politics. It must always remain above politics. Because America and Israel, we share a common destiny, the destiny of promised lands that cherish freedom and offer hope. Israel is grateful for the support of American -- of America's people and of America's presidents, from Harry Truman to Barack Obama. We appreciate all that President Obama has done for Israel. Now, some of that is widely known. Some of that is w In each of those moments, I called the president, and he was there. And some of what the president has done for Israel might never be known, because it touches on some of the most sensitive and strategic issues that arise between an American president and an Israeli prime minister. But I know it, and I will always be grateful to President Obama for that support. And Israel is grateful to you, the American Congress, for your support, for supporting us in so many ways, especially in generous military assistance and missile defense, including Iron Dome. Last summer, millions of Israelis were protected from thousands of Hamas rockets because this capital dome helped build our Iron Dome. Thank you, America. Thank you for everything you've done for Israel. My friends, I've come here today because, as prime minister of Israel, I feel a profound obligation to speak to you about an issue that could well threaten the survival of my country and the future of my people: Iran's quest for nuclear weapons. We’re an ancient people. In our nearly 4,000 years of history, many have tried repeatedly to destroy the Jewish people. Tomorrow night, on the Jewish holiday of Purim, we'll read the Book of Esther. We'll read of a powerful Persian viceroy named Haman, who plotted to destroy the Jewish people some 2,500 years ago. But a courageous Jewish woman, Queen Esther, exposed the plot and gave for the Jewish people the right to defend themselves against their enemies. The plot was foiled. Our people were saved.Today the Jewish people face another attempt by yet another Persian potentate to destroy us. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei spews the oldest hatred, the oldest hatred of anti-Semitism with the newest technology. He tweets that Israel must be annihilated -- he tweets. You know, in Iran, there isn't exactly free Internet. But he tweets in English that Israel must be destroyed. For those who believe that Iran threatens the Jewish state, but not the Jewish people, listen to Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, Iran's chief terrorist proxy. He said: If all the Jews gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of chasing them down around the world. But Iran's regime is not merely a Jewish problem, any more than the Nazi regime was merely a Jewish problem. The 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis were but a fraction of the 60 million people killed in World War II. So, too, Iran's regime poses a grave threat, not only to Israel, but also the peace of the entire world. To understand just how dangerous Iran would be with nuclear weapons, we must fully understand the nature of the regime. The people of Iran are very talented people. They're heirs to one of the world's great civilizations. idely known, like strengthening security cooperation and intelligence sharing, opposing anti-Israel resolutions at the U.N.Some of what the president has done for Israel is less well- known.I called him in 2010 when we had the Carmel forest fire, and he immediately agreed to respond to my request for urgent aid.In 2011, we had our embassy in Cairo under siege, and again, he provided vital assistance at the crucial moment. Or his support for more missile interceptors during our operation last summer when we took on Hamas terrorists.But in 1979, they were hijacked by religious zealots -- religious zealots who imposed on them immediately a dark and brutal dictatorship. That year, the zealots drafted a constitution, a new one for Iran. It directed the revolutionary guards not only to protect Iran's borders, but also to fulfill the ideological mission of jihad. The regime's founder, Ayatollah Khomeini, exhorted his followers to ""export the revolution throughout the world. ""I'm standing here in Washington, D.C. and the difference is so stark. America's founding document promises life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Iran's founding document pledges death, tyranny, and the pursuit of jihad. And as states are collapsing across the Middle East, Iran is charging into the void to do just that.Iran's goons in Gaza, its lackeys in Lebanon, its revolutionary guards on the Golan Heights are clutching Israel with three tentacles of terror. Backed by Iran, Assad is slaughtering Syrians. Back by Iran, Shiite militias are rampaging through Iraq. Back by Iran, Houthis are seizing control of Yemen, threatening the strategic straits at the mouth of the Red Sea. Along with the Straits of Hormuz, that would give Iran a second choke-point on the world's oil supply.Just last week, near Hormuz, Iran carried out a military exercise blowing up a mock U.S. aircraft carrier. That's just last week, while they're having nuclear talks with the United States. But unfortunately, for the last 36 years, Iran's attacks against the United States have been anything but mock. And the targets have been all too real. Iran took dozens of Americans hostage in Tehran, murdered hundreds of American soldiers, Marines, in Beirut, and was responsible for killing and maiming thousands of American service men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan.Beyond the Middle East, Iran attacks America and its allies through its global terror network. It blew up the Jewish community center and the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. It helped Al Qaida bomb U.S. embassies in Africa. It even attempted to assassinate the Saudi ambassador, right here in Washington, D.C.In the Middle East, Iran now dominates four Arab capitals, Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut and Sanaa. And if Iran's aggression is left unchecked, more will surely follow. So, at a time when many hope that Iran will join the community of nations, Iran is busy gobbling up the nations. We must all stand together to stop Iran's march of conquest, subjugation and terror. Now, two years ago, we were told to give President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif a chance to bring change and moderation to Iran. Some change! Some moderation! Rouhani's government hangs gays, persecutes Christians, jails journalists and executes even more prisoners than before.Last year, the same Zarif who charms Western diplomats laid a wreath at the grave of Imad Mughniyeh. Imad Mughniyeh is the terrorist mastermind who spilled more American blood than any other terrorist besides Osama bin Laden. I'd like to see someone ask him a question about that. Iran's regime is as radical as ever, its cries of ""Death to America,"" that same America that it calls the ""Great Satan,"" as loud as ever. Now, this shouldn't be surprising, because the ideology of Iran's revolutionary regime is deeply rooted in militant Islam, and that's why this regime will always be an enemy of America. Don't be fooled. The battle between Iran and ISIS doesn't turn Iran into a friend of America. Iran and ISIS are competing for the crown of militant Islam. One calls itself the Islamic Republic. The other calls itself the Islamic State. Both want to impose a militant Islamic empire first on the region and then on the entire world. They just disagree among themselves who will be the ruler of that empire. In this deadly game of thrones, there's no place for America or for Israel, no peace for Christians, Jews or Muslims who don't share the Islamist medieval creed, no rights for women, no freedom for anyone. So when it comes to Iran and ISIS, the enemy of your enemy is your enemy.The difference is that ISIS is armed with butcher knives, captured weapons and YouTube, whereas Iran could soon be armed with intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear bombs. We must always remember -- I'll say it one more time -- the greatest dangers facing our world is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons. To defeat ISIS and let Iran get nuclear weapons would be to win the battle, but lose the war. We can't let that happen.But that, my friends, is exactly what could happen, if the deal now being negotiated is accepted by Iran. That deal will not prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. It would all but guarantee that Iran gets those weapons, lots of them. Let me explain why. While the final deal has not yet been signed, certain elements of any potential deal are now a matter of public record. You don't need intelligence agencies and secret information to know this. You can Google it. Absent a dramatic change, we know for sure that any deal with Iran will include two major concessions to Iran. The first major concession would leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure, providing it with a short break-out time to the bomb. Break-out time is the time it takes to amass enough weapons-grade uranium or plutonium for a nuclear bomb. According to the deal, not a single nuclear facility would be demolished. Thousands of centrifuges used to enrich uranium would be left spinning. Thousands more would be temporarily disconnected, but not destroyed. Because Iran's nuclear program would be left largely intact, Iran's break-out time would be very short -- about a year by U.S. assessment, even shorter by Israel's. And if -- if Iran's work on advanced centrifuges, faster and faster centrifuges, is not stopped, that break-out time could still be shorter, a lot shorter. True, certain restrictions would be imposed on Iran's nuclear program and Iran's adherence to those restrictions would be supervised by international inspectors. But here's the problem. You see, inspectors document violations; they don't stop them. Inspectors knew when North Korea broke to the bomb, but that didn't stop anything. North Korea turned off the cameras, kicked out the inspectors. Within a few years, it got the bomb. Now, we're warned that within five years North Korea could have an arsenal of 100 nuclear bombs. Like North Korea, Iran, too, has defied international inspectors. It's done that on at least three separate occasions -- 2005, 2006, 2010. Like North Korea, Iran broke the locks, shut off the cameras Now, I know this is not gonna come a shock -- as a shock to any of you, but Iran not only defies inspectors, it also plays a pretty good game of hide-and-cheat with them. The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, said again yesterday that Iran still refuses to come clean about its military nuclear program. Iran was also caught -- caught twice, not once, twice -- operating secret nuclear facilities in Natanz and Qom, facilities that inspectors didn't even know existed. Right now, Iran could be hiding nuclear facilities that we don't know about, the U.S. and Israel. As the former head of inspections for the IAEA said in 2013, he said, ""If there's no undeclared installation today in Iran, it will be the first time in 20 years that it doesn't have one."" Iran has proven time and again that it cannot be trusted. And that's why the first major concession is a source of great concern. It leaves Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure and relies on inspectors to prevent a breakout. That concession creates a real danger that Iran could get to the bomb by violating the deal. But the second major concession creates an even greater danger that Iran could get to the bomb by keeping the deal. Because virtually all the restrictions on Iran's nuclear program will automatically expire in about a decade. Now, a decade may seem like a long time in political life, but it's the blink of an eye in the life of a nation. It's a blink of an eye in the life of our children. We all have a responsibility to consider what will happen when Iran's nuclear capabilities are virtually unrestricted and all the sanctions will have been lifted. Iran would then be free to build a huge nuclear capacity that could product many, many nuclear bombs. Iran's Supreme Leader says that openly. He says, Iran plans to have 190,000 centrifuges, not 6,000 or even the 19,000 that Iran has today, but 10 times that amount -- 190,000 centrifuges enriching uranium. With this massive capacity, Iran could make the fuel for an entire nuclear arsenal and this in a matter of weeks, once it makes that decision. My long-time friend, John Kerry, Secretary of State, confirmed last week that Iran could legitimately possess that massive centrifuge capacity when the deal expires.  Now I want you to think about that. The foremost sponsor of global terrorism could be weeks away from having enough enriched uranium for an entire arsenal of nuclear weapons and this with full international legitimacy. And by the way, if Iran's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile program is not part of the deal, and so far, Iran refuses to even put it on the negotiating table. Well, Iran could have the means to deliver that nuclear arsenal to the far-reach corners of the earth, including to every part of the United States. So you see, my friends, this deal has two major concessions: one, leaving Iran with a vast nuclear program and two, lifting the restrictions on that program in about a decade. That's why this deal is so bad. It doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb; it paves Iran's path to the bomb.So why would anyone make this deal? Because they hope that Iran will change for the better in the coming years, or they believe that the alternative to this deal is worse? Well, I disagree. I don't believe that Iran's radical regime will change for the better after this deal. This regime has been in power for 36 years, and its voracious appetite for aggression grows with each passing year. This deal would wet appetite -- would only wet Iran's appetite for more. Would Iran be less aggressive when sanctions are removed and its economy is stronger? If Iran is gobbling up four countries right now while it's under sanctions, how many more countries will Iran devour when sanctions are lifted? Would Iran fund less terrorism when it has mountains of cash with which to fund more terrorism? Why should Iran's radical regime change for the better when it can enjoy the best of both world's: aggression abroad, prosperity at home? This is a question that everyone asks in our region. Israel's neighbors -- Iran's neighbors know that Iran will become even more aggressive and sponsor even more terrorism when its economy is unshackled and it's been given a clear path to the bomb. And many of these neighbors say they'll respond by racing to get nuclear weapons of their own. So this deal won't change Iran for the better; it will only change the Middle East for the worse. A deal that's supposed to prevent nuclear proliferation would instead spark a nuclear arms race in the most dangerous part of the planet. This deal won't be a farewell to arms. It would be a farewell to arms control. And the Middle East would soon be crisscrossed by nuclear tripwires. A region where small skirmishes can trigger big wars would turn into a nuclear tinderbox.  If anyone thinks -- if anyone thinks this deal kicks the can down the road, think again. When we get down that road, we'll face a much more dangerous Iran, a Middle East littered with nuclear bombs and a countdown to a potential nuclear nightmare. Ladies and gentlemen, I've come here today to tell you we don't have to bet the security of the world on the hope that Iran will change for the better. We don't have to gamble with our future and with our children's future. We can insist that restrictions on Iran's nuclear program not be lifted for as long as Iran continues its aggression in the region and in the world. Before lifting those restrictions, the world should demand that Iran do three things. First, stop its aggression against its neighbors in the Middle East. Second. Second, stop supporting terrorism around the world. And third, stop threatening to annihilate my country, Israel, the one and only Jewish state. Thank you. If the world powers are not prepared to insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal is signed, at the very least they should insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal expires. If Iran changes its behavior, the restrictions would be lifted. If Iran doesn't change its behavior, the restrictions should not be lifted. If Iran wants to be treated like a normal country, let it act like a normal country. My friends, what about the argument that there's no alternative to this deal, that Iran's nuclear know-how cannot be erased, that its nuclear program is so advanced that the best we can do is delay the inevitable, which is essentially what the proposed deal seeks to do? Well, nuclear know-how without nuclear infrastructure doesn't get you very much. A racecar driver without a car can't drive. A pilot without a plan can't fly. Without thousands of centrifuges, tons of enriched uranium or heavy water facilities, Iran can't make nuclear weapons. Iran's nuclear program can be rolled back well-beyond the current proposal by insisting on a better deal and keeping up the pressure on a very vulnerable regime, especially given the recent collapse in the price of oil. Now, if Iran threatens to walk away from the table -- and this often happens in a Persian bazaar -- call their bluff. They'll be back, because they need the deal a lot more than you do. And by maintaining the pressure on Iran and on those who do business with Iran, you have the power to make them need it even more. My friends, for over a year, we've been told that no deal is better than a bad deal. Well, this is a bad deal. It's a very bad deal. We're better off without it. Now we're being told that the only alternative to this bad deal is war. That's just not true. The alternative to this bad deal is a much better deal. A better deal that doesn't leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure and such a short break-out time. A better deal that keeps the restrictions on Iran's nuclear program in place until Iran's aggression ends. A better deal that won't give Iran an easy path to the bomb. A better deal that Israel and its neighbors may not like, but with which we could live, literally. And no country...... no country has a greater stake -- no country has a greater stake than Israel in a good deal that peacefully removes this threat. Ladies and gentlemen, history has placed us at a fateful crossroads. We must now choose between two paths. One path leads to a bad deal that will at best curtail Iran's nuclear ambitions for a while, but it will inexorably lead to a nuclear-armed Iran whose unbridled aggression will inevitably lead to war. The second path, however difficult, could lead to a much better deal, that would prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, a nuclearized Middle East and the horrific consequences of both to all of humanity. You don't have to read Robert Frost to know. You have to live life to know that the difficult path is usually the one less traveled, but it will make all the difference for the future of my country, the security of the Middle East and the peace of the world, the peace, we all desire. My friend, standing up to Iran is not easy. Standing up to dark and murderous regimes never is. With us today is Holocaust survivor and Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel. Elie, your life and work inspires to give meaning to the words, ""never again."" And I wish I could promise you, Elie, that the lessons of history have been learned. I can only urge the leaders of the world not to repeat the mistakes of the past. Not to sacrifice the future for the present; not to ignore aggression in the hopes of gaining an illusory peace. But I can guarantee you this, the days when the Jewish people remained passive in the face of genocidal enemies, those days are over. We are no longer scattered among the nations, powerless to defend ourselves. We restored our sovereignty in our ancient home. And the soldiers who defend our home have boundless courage. For the first time in 100 generations, we, the Jewish people, can defend ourselves. This is why -- this is why, as a prime minister of Israel, I can promise you one more thing: Even if Israel has to stand alone, Israel will stand.But I know that Israel does not stand alone. I know that America stands with Israel. I know that you stand with Israel.You stand with Israel, because you know that the story of Israel is not only the story of the Jewish people but of the human spirit that refuses again and again to succumb to history's horrors. Facing me right up there in the gallery, overlooking all of us in this chamber is the image of Moses. Moses led our people from slavery to the gates of the Promised Land.And before the people of Israel entered the land of Israel, Moses gave us a message that has steeled our resolve for thousands of years. I leave you with his message today, ""Be strong and resolute, neither fear nor dread them.""My friends, may Israel and America always stand together, strong and resolute. May we neither fear nor dread the challenges ahead. May we face the future with confidence, strength and hope. May God bless the state of Israel and may God bless the United States of America.Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you all. You're wonderful. Thank you, America. Thank you.",247,188,0,Republican,54,44,2,Republican,114
Petro Poroshenko,Ukraine ,369,9,2014,President ,"Mr. Speaker, Majority Leader, Members of the House, Members of the Senate Ladies and Gentlemen, Let me thank you for your warmth and hospitality. Addressing both houses of Congress is one of the highest political privileges. Standing here, I am grateful – and fully aware that this honor goes not to me, but to the people of Ukraine – those brave men and women who are today on the forefront of the global fight for democracy! Allow me speak to you on their behalf.I will focus on one thing that is at the core of Ukraine’s existence today: freedom. There are moments in history when freedom is more than just a political concept. At those moments, freedom becomes the ultimate choice, which defines who you are – as a person and as a nation. Ukraine has lived this moment over the last 10 months – and became the scene of the most heroic story of the last decade, a synonym for sacrifice, dedication and the unbreakable will to live free. The people of Ukraine stood up to the corrupt regime of Yakukovych. They stood their ground during this dramatic winter – and they are standing their ground right now! The defenders of freedom were willing to sacrifice their lives for the sake of a better future. What is even more amazing, they won. Armed with only sticks and shields, they attacked the special police and chased them away. The victory gained on the Independence Square in Kyiv, now known to the whole world as Maidan was a victory against police brutality, harassment by the state-controlled media, violence, and intimidation. There is nothing more impressive than seeing hundreds of thousands of peaceful people forcing out a violent dictator, and changing the course of history. Day after day, week after week, month after month – thousands upon thousands streamed into the streets of Kyiv, simply because their dignity didn’t allow them to remain passive and silent, while their liberties were at stake. The stand-off on the Maidan lasted three months. It culminated on February 20th and 21st – when over 100 protesters were shot by snipers. We call them the “Heavenly Hundred”. We revere them as true national heroes. We applaud their heroism! Ladies and Gentlemen, In February, when the world saw that no one could take away Ukraine’s freedom – an external aggressor decided to take away a part of Ukraine’s territory. The annexation of Crimea became one of the most cynical acts of treachery in modern history. Ukraine, which gave up the world’s third-largest nuclear potential in exchange for security assurances, was stabbed in the back by one of the countries who gave her those assurances. Allow me to remind you: 20 years ago, in the Budapest Memorandum, Russia along with the United States, the United Kingdom, France and China vowed to provide for the inviolability of Ukraine’s state borders and territorial sovereignty. In reality, what we got from Russia was annexation and a war that has brought Ukraine to the brink of its survival. The Soviet Union had collapsed too quickly, creating the illusion that this chapter in history was closed, and that this story had come to the end. But in the minds of the people, it has not ended. The imperialistic mindset is still there. Nostalgia for the Soviet Union and the dismissal of the settlement that ended the Cold War has been cultivating revisionist instincts. In 2008, Russian troops occupied Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Now they have invaded Ukraine.  The right to protect ethnic Russians, and even Russian speakers, can and already has become a reason to fan the flames of war. Besides Ukraine, the Russian speakers reside in Moldova, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Baltic States, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria. Moldova, Georgia, Ukraine – what happens next? Many things, including the effectiveness of the global non-proliferation system, will be put to a severe test and judged depending on the response of America, and the world, to that question. Even NATO allies are at risk. As if to underline this point, two days after President Barack Obama’s visit to Estonia, the day the NATO summit ended, an Estonian intelligence officer was abducted and accused of espionage. The security assurances that were extended to Ukraine then have failed to work, proving that no agreements or treaties can secure world order. So, what can bring peace and maintain it? – Common values, cooperation, and interdependence; leadership, and responsibility. Therefore, I urge you not to let Ukraine stand alone in the face of this aggression. The United States made a commitment that it would stand behind Ukraine’s territorial integrity – and we hope that it will live up to that promise. Democracies must support each other. They must show solidarity in the face of aggression and adversity. Otherwise, they will be eliminated – one by one. The aggression against Ukraine has become one of the worst setbacks for the cause of democracy in the world in years. With just one move, the world has been thrown back in time – to a reality of territorial claims, zones of influence, criminal aggression and annexations. Within two weeks Crimea was invaded and annexed. Ukraine was not prepared to face the enemy.The consequences were devastating. The post-war international system of checks and balances was effectively ruined. The world was plunged into the worst security crisis since the US-USSR stand-off of 1962. Today, we are witnessing another attempt at dividing the world, and Ukraine stands at the center of this attempt. The outcome of today’s war will determine whether we will be forced to accept the reality of a dark, torn, and bitter Europe as part of a new world order. These Ukrainian army, these young boys underequipped, and often unappreciated by the world are the only thing that now stands between the reality of peaceful coexistence and the nightmare of a full relapse into the previous century and a new cold war. And should that happen, then this would neither be the end of it, nor the worst of it. The war that these young men are fighting today is not only Ukraine’s war. It is Europe’s, and it is America’s war, too. It is a war of the free world – and for a free world! Today, aggression against Ukraine is a threat to global security everywhere. Hybrid proxy wars, terrorism, national radical and extremist movements, the erosion of international agreements, the blurring, and even erasing, of national identities: all of these threats now challenge Europe. If they are not stopped now, they will cross European borders and spread throughout the globe. To prevent this, thousands of Ukrainian soldiers are in the line of fire right now. Speaking in the United States Congress, from this high beacon of freedom, I want to thank them for their sacrifice! I urge the world to recognize and endorse their fight! They need more political support! And they need more military equipment – both non-lethal and lethal. Blankets and night-vision goggles are important. But one cannot win a war with blankets! I thank all those in America who realize and appreciate the historic importance of this fight. Just like Israel, Ukraine has the right to defend her territory – and it will do so, with all the courage of her heart and dedication of her soul! I urge America to help us and to rise and be equal to its natural and manifest role – I urge America to lead the way! Ukraine has always had a special bond with the United States. Today, Ukraine is taking shape as America’s natural and consequential partner in the region.This partnership is not circumstantial. It has not come about because we find ourselves “in the same boat”. It came about because, in the moment of existential crisis, Ukraine’s choice was the same as America’s: freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. In a time of Europe’s skepticism and Russia’s open, unprovoked hostility, Ukrainian citizens have been ready to give their lives to see Ukraine democratic and free. Circumstantial “boats” can change. The nature of a people cannot. It is in the nature of the Ukrainian people to tolerate no dictators and to strive for their freedom – no matter what. Given today’s situation, Ukraine’s democracy will have to rely on a strong army. In the upcoming years, building a strong military will be another existential test for Ukrainian democracy. I see it as my utmost duty to rectify the damage done to the Ukrainian military and to give Ukraine a strong, modern army that we can be proud of. With this in mind, I strongly encourage the United States to give Ukraine special, non-allied partner status. I also ask that the United States be forceful and stand by its principles with respect to further sanctions against the aggressor. Economic sanctions are important for many reasons. They help to distinguish between good and evil. They help us defend and stand the moral high ground and not to sink into indifference disguised as pragmatism. I understand that the wars of the last decade have taken a heavy toll on the economy of the West. I understand that American citizens and taxpayers want peace, not war. So do Ukrainian citizens and taxpayers. However, there are moments in history, whose importance cannot be measured solely in percentages of GDP growth. Ukraine’s war is the only war of the last decade that is purely about values. One nation decided to be free and democratic. Another nation decided to punish her for this. The world simply cannot allow this kind of behavior! “Values come first” – this is the truth the West would remind Ukraine of over the last years. Now it is Ukraine’s turn to remind the West of this truth! Allow me to also say this: there is no way, at no price, and under no condition, that we will ever put up with Crimea’s occupation. Ending the occupation and annulling the annexation is not only an integral precondition to a full normalization of relations between Ukraine and Russia. It is also an integral precondition to Crimea’s prosperity and modernization! Until this precondition is fulfilled, I urge America and the world to stand united in sending a signal to the aggressors of today and of the future, that the policy and practice of annexation will never be tolerated. Clearly I am not talking about a military solution of the Crimean problem. This will be a dilemma for many years; a choice between two ways of life and two political, economic, and social systems. But I have no doubt that in the long run the system that offers the greater freedom will prevail. It always does! Ladies and Gentlemen, The last half-year has been a time of ultimate challenge for millions of Ukrainians. It was a time of heroism and sacrifice. To many – it became the ultimate sacrifice. Let me share with you two human stories that illustrate my point. On March 3rd, when the occupation of Crimea just started, there was one man in the Crimean city of Simferopol who did the unthinkable. When millions felt paralyzed and stunned at what was unfolding before their eyes, Reshat Ametov, a 39-year-old father of three, decided not to be silent. This brave son of the Crimean Tatar people went on a one-man protest in front of the occupied City Hall. He did nothing more than hold a sheet of paper that said “NO to Occupation!” A group of unknown people arrested him and transported him away – in the plain sight of dozens of witnesses and in front of TV cameras. Two weeks later he was found tortured and executed – mafia-style. Just the thought of this man’s final tormented minutes sends chills down my spine. I ask myself – what made this hero do what he did? And I can find no other answer than – he did it for freedom; so that his children would not face slavery like that of a neo-Stalinist dictatorship. I am convinced that years from now, when Crimea’s occupation will belong to the past, the Crimean people will think about what he did and salute his braveness – just like I do now! Ukraine will always stand together with the Crimean Tatar people, whose language, rights, and culture are being trampled upon right now – as they were many years ago under Soviet rule. I urge America and the world not to be silent about these crimes. It is Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars who are being oppressed in Crimea today. And it is time for all people of good will to rephrase John Kennedy’s words from over 50 years ago: “I am a Crimean Tatar!” – and there is nothing that would make me give up my freedom! Let me also commemorate Volodymyr Rybak, a 42-year-old father of two, and a member of the municipal parliament of East Ukrainian Horlivka. On April 15, he confronted the separatists and Russian special-ops officers over a separatist flag that they were trying to hoist atop the local administration building. Just like Reshat Ametov – he was abducted and tortured. His last hours must have been unthinkable. His body was badly mutilated. Today I stand here – in awe of this tragedy, and of the courage and sacrifice of this man, and of the courage and sacrifice of millions of Ukrainians. From the bottom of my heart, I deeply believe that there will be a time (and very soon!), when Horlivka’s central square will be named after Volodymyr and when schoolchildren will bring flowers to his monument. Ladies and Gentlemen, Make no mistake: Europe’s, and the world’s, choice right now is not a choice between a uni-polar and a multi-polar order. Neither is it a choice between different kinds of civilizations. It is a choice between civilization and barbarism. And while standing at this juncture, before this great trial – the democratic world cannot shrink or hesitate! We do not want to see all the democratic accomplishments of the last decades to be erased and to have been for nothing. The free world must stand its ground. And with America’s help – it will! We live in a world that is mutually reliant and interconnected. In this world, the aggression on one democratic nation is aggression against all. If anyone had doubts about this, if anyone was hoping “to sit it out” while Ukrainians and Russians continue killing each other – this ended on July 18th, when a Russian missile launched by a Russian mercenary shot down the civilian Boeing-777. 298 innocent, peaceful people, many of whom were flying on their vacations in the South, met their ultimate demise in the steppes of Ukraine. Their cold-blooded killing (just like the barbaric treatment of their remains afterwards) showed that whoever floods Europe with uncontrolled weapons – puts millions of lives at risk. For years and decades to come. This was an indisputable brutal act of terror. Unfortunately, it was this tragedy that gave a wake up call to many in the world about the situation in Ukraine. Long after wars end – the fear and hate linger on. How many more deaths will be caused by the handguns handed out, with absolutely no controls or accountability, in those regions? How many innocent children will step on land mines so massively utilized by separatists? How many lives will be ruined and souls poisoned by the propaganda machine? The act of pumping the region full of uncontrolled arms  represents a policy of state-funded terrorism – and it needs to stop now! The cynical downing of the Malaysian Boeing revealed one more important thing: we are now at the forefront of the fight against terrorism. And we need to join our efforts to effectively respond to this challenge. With this said, people throughout the world are asking the same questions. “Are we on the eve of a new cold war?” “Is the possibility of a new, terrible and unimaginable European war there?” “Is what until recently seemed unthinkable now becoming a reality?” Sadly, today, the answer to these questions is – “Yes.” However, we cannot and must not accept this as an inevitability. As recently as 2008, the then president of Russia ran his election campaign under the slogan “Freedom is better than non-freedom.” I am sure that, despite the Crimean annexation and the ongoing aggression, millions of Russians still remember that slogan and take it seriously. Let’s remind them of it! Let’s show them that freedom is not a luxury (as some try to convince them), but a necessity – and a precondition for the true success of a nation! I am convinced that the people of Ukraine and the people of Russia have enough goodwill to give peace one last chance and prevail against the spirit of hate. That’s why my presidency began with a Peace Plan and a one-sided ceasefire. That’s why we are holding our fire now. That’s why two armies stand before each other – without massively shedding each other’s blood. And if things work out right – they will not have to! I am in daily contact with the leaders of the world, including the leader of Russia. The dialogue is not easy. Over these last months, too much goodwill was destroyed. Too much hate was generated – naturally and artificially. Too many people have died. Based on that, I feel there is a growing mutual recognition that enough is enough! The bloodshed must stop! The pandemic of hate must be localized and contained! As president, looking in the eyes of the mothers and wives of the dead soldiers and civilians has been my hardest duty. No one can take it lightly. Today, it’s my burden – and the burden of President Putin. As he lit a candle in a Moscow church to remember those who perished in this war last week – I did the same in Kyiv. And from the bottom of heart, I deeply, profoundly wish that church candles would be the only things burned in Ukraine from now on. Over the last months, Ukrainians have shown that they have the courage to stand up to the most powerful enemy. We will never obey or bend to the aggressor. We are ready to fight.  But we are a people of peace. I am ready to do my utmost to avoid a further escalation and casualties – even at this point, when the war has already started feeding on itself. Sooner or later, peace will return to Ukrainian homes. And despite the insanity of this war, I am convinced that peace can be achieved – sooner rather than later! I am ready to offer those who live in Donbas more rights than any part of Ukraine has ever had in the history of the nation. I am ready to discuss anything – accept one thing – Ukraine’s dismemberment. And I am confident: if this war is about rights, and not about geopolitical ambitions – a solution must, and will be, found! Ladies and Gentlemen, In 1991, independence came to Ukraine peacefully. Yet, the more real this independence became – the higher grew its cost. Today that cost is as high as it gets. While fighting this war, we learn to value independence and to recognize true friends. And at no point to we ever forget WHY we need independence. We need it to have a country worthy of the dreams of our ancestors. We need a state that would give its citizens a life of dignity, fairness and equal opportunity. To reach this goal – we will have to root out the sins that drained Ukraine’s potential for such a long time and made the two decades of independence a time of lost opportunities. We are painfully aware of these sins, largely inherited from the era of Soviet decay: corruption, bureaucracy and the self-preserving cynicism of political elites. There is a saying that each people deserve the government it gets. Ukraine’s two revolutions within a single decade show that Ukraine needs and deserves deep and profound modernization in all spheres – of the kind that brought economic success to our Western neighbors. Given the current situation in and around Ukraine, the implementation of comprehensive reforms is not a matter of Ukraine succeeding, but of Ukraine surviving. Deeply aware of that, I gave my voters this pledge – and I will stick to it! With the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement signed and ratified this treaty simultaneously in the Ukrainian and the European Parliament – we have a clear path of reforms before us. Never in the history of the European Union was there a document that was paid for so dearly – at such incredible human cost and sacrifice. And this sacrifice, the memory of the hundreds dead and wounded, will be one more reason and incentive to hold to this unique chance to make Ukraine live up to its potential. Ukraine needs modern governance and non-corrupt public administration! Ukraine needs to delegate more powers to local communities! Ukraine needs to rely more on its strong, vibrant, and dynamic civil society! Ukraine is building a new model of managing its state and economic affairs, where merit and hard work are duly rewarded! Ukraine needs know-how, technology, and new start-ups to become better integrated with the global economy. And for all that – we need America’s help! In particular, I ask the Congress to create a special fund to support investments of American companies in Ukraine, and to help us with reforming our economy and our justice system! I assure you that all aid received from the West will be utilized by non-corrupt institutions and that the new generation of officials will make sure the funds are distributed effectively. Ladies and Gentlemen, We called our revolution the Revolution of Dignity. Human dignity was the driving force that took people to the streets. This revolution must result in an education of dignity, an economy of dignity, and a society of dignity. Human dignity is what makes Ukraine’s heart beat and Ukraine’s mind look toward a new and better version of itself. Human dignity is the one thing we have to oppose to the barbarism of those attacking us. It is the one thing that we can set against the sea of lies in which the highly sophisticated and well-funded machine of Russian propaganda is trying to drown the truth about Ukrainian democracy. In the coming years, too many things will depend on Ukraine’s success. This success will be determined by Ukraine’s new leadership, by its new political generation and by the newly mobilized society of Ukraine. Ukraine truly makes a difference. By supporting Ukraine, you support a new future for Europe and the entire free world. By supporting Ukraine, you support a nation that has chosen freedom in the most cynical of times. In Ukraine, you don’t build a democracy – it already exists. You just defend it! This is what makes Ukraine unique, and its struggle deeply and profoundly different from other conflicts on the world scene. This is what makes Ukraine the ultimate test of adherence to the ideal of freedom! “Live free or die!” – was one of the mottos of the American Revolutionary War. “Live free or die!” – was the spirit on the revolutionary Maidan during the dramatic winter months of 2014. “Live free or die!” are the words of Ukrainian soldiers standing on the line of freedom in this war. “Live free!” – must be the answer, with which Ukraine comes out of this war. “Live free!” – must be the message Ukraine and America send to the world, while standing together in this time of enormous challenge. Thank you",234,201,0,Republican,45,53,2,Democrat,113
Park Geun Hye,Republic of Korea ,732,5,2013,President,"Speaker Boehner, Vice President Biden, distinguished members of the House and the Senate, ladies and gentlemen, I am privileged to stand in this chamber—this hallowed ground of freedom and democracy—to speak about our friendship and our future together. After I arrived in Washington the day before yesterday, I went to the Korean War Memorial near the banks of the Potomac. I read the words etched in granite: “Our nation honors her sons and daughters, who answered the call to defend a country they never knew and a people they never met.” Time and again, I am moved when I read those familiar words. Let me express—on behalf of the people of the Republic of Korea—our profound gratitude to America’s veterans. Their blood, sweat and tears helped safeguard freedom and democracy. I also offer my heartfelt appreciation to four men in particular. They served in that war and now serve in this chamber. Their names are Congressmen John Conyers, Charles Rangel, Sam Johnson and Howard Coble. Gentlemen, my country thanks you. When the guns fell silent in the summer of 1953, Koreans were surviving on 67 dollars a year. Six decades later, Korea is one of the top five car producers and the eighth-largest trading nation. Some call this the “Miracle on the Han River.” But for those of us in Korea, it was anything but a miracle. And it wasn’t just built from within. Koreans worked tirelessly in the mines of Germany, in the jungles of Vietnam, and in the deserts of the Middle East. These are the people—the proud Korean people—I am so honored to serve as President. They are the ones that made Korea what it is today. Together, we will write a sequel to that story: “A Second Miracle on the Han River.” This time, it will be written with a revived economy, with a people that are happy, with a flourishing culture, and on a pathway to a reunified Peninsula. These are the four tenets that guide my government. We also know that we didn’t come this far on our own. Along our journey we have been aided by great friends and among them, the United States is second to none. America, I thank you for your friendship. If the past is anything to go by, our new journey will also be filled with excitement. This year, we honor the 60thanniversaryofouralliance. And today, I would like to acknowledge one iconic family that captures those 60 years. It is the family of Lieutenant Colonel David Morgan. Colonel Morgan’s grandfather, the late Warren Morgan, fought in the Korean War. The senior Morgan was a commander in the U.S. Naval Reserve. His father, John Morgan, also served in the Korean War. He was a battery commander of the 213th Field Artillery. Colonel Morgan himself has served two tours in Korea in 1992 and 2005. The Morgan family is a living testimony to our 60 years together—three generations of Americans helping to safeguard Korea. As President of a grateful nation, I salute the Morgan family and the commitment and friendship of the American people. Looking forward, our precious alliance is setting its sights on a better world—a brighter future. Bound by trust, guided by shared values, we are cooperating across and beyond our own boundaries. Korea has stood by the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan. Together, we supported peace-building and reconstruction in those nations. Following the Washington conference in 2010, Seoul hosted the 2nd Nuclear Security Summit last year. There were affirmed our commitment to the vision of “a world without nuclear weapons. “A world without nuclear weapons”—President Obama’s vision—must start on the Korean Peninsula. For the Peninsula is home to the only divided nation-state and directly faces the threat of nuclear weapons. It is an ideal test-bed for a future free of nuclear arms. If we can pull it off on the Korean Peninsula, then we can pull it off anywhere else. Korea has been pursuing the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It is also firmly committed to the principle of non-proliferation. Korea and the United States are partnering to build reactors in third countries. In this regard, we need a modernized, mutually beneficial successor to our existing civil nuclear agreement. Such an accord will bring huge benefits to related industries in both our countries. Our partnership also extends to development assistance. The United States and Korea send the largest numbers of aid volunteers abroad. We will work side by side to help lower-income countries. In 2011, our aid agencies signed a document that facilitates these efforts. And Korea’s aid agency will soon be signing another with the US Peace Corps. In March of last year, the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement went into effect. The agreement adds an economic pillar to our alliance. It has moved us closer to a comprehensive strategic alliance. We can do even more. If the bill on visa quotas for Korean professionals is passed in this Congress, both our economies will benefit, for it would help create many more jobs. It would show our people what the FTA can do for them. I ask Congress for its understanding—for its support. Our FTA also connects East Asia and North America and provides a key platform for building a common Asia-Pacific market. The agreement also helps underpin Washington’s rebalancing toward the region. Collectively, these developments paint a forward-leaning alliance. They point to a 21st century partnership that is both comprehensive and strategic. Ladies and gentlemen, That is our present, the foundation on which we stand. I now wish to share my vision of “our future together”—a future that we will build together as partners. Following our meeting yesterday, President Obama and I adopted a Joint Declaration. Building on the extraordinary accomplishments of the last sixty years, we determined to embark on another shared journey toward peace on the Korean Peninsula, toward cooperation in Northeast Asia, and finally toward prosperity around the world. It is my hope that as we make this journey, our partnership will be guided by a three-part vision. The first is to lay the groundwork for enduring peace on the Korean Peninsula and over time for reunification. That future, I know, feels distant today. North Korea continues to issue threats and provocations firing long-range missiles, staging nuclear tests that undermine peace on the Peninsula and far beyond it. The Korean government is reacting resolutely, but calmly. We are maintaining the highest level of readiness. We are strengthening our cooperation with the US and other international partners. Korea’s economy and financial markets remain stable. Companies—both domestic and foreign—see this, and are expanding their investments. Korea’s economic fundamentals are strong. Its government is equal to the task. And it is backed by the might of our alliance. So long as this continues you may rest assured: no North Korean provocation can succeed. I will remain steadfast in pushing forward a process of trust-building on the Korean Peninsula. I am confident that trust is the path to peace—the path to a Korea that is whole again. The Republic of Korea will never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea. Pyongyang’s provocations will be met decisively. At the same time, I will not link humanitarian aid provided to the North Korean people, such as infants and young children, to the political situation. And with the trust that gradually builds up, through exchange, through cooperation, we will cement the grounds for durable peace and —eventually— peaceful reunification. But as we say in Korea, it takes two hands to clap. Trust is not something that can be imposed on another. The pattern is all too familiar—and badly misguided. North Korea provokes a crisis. The international community imposes a certain period of sanctions. Later, it tries to patch things up by offering concessions and rewards. Meanwhile, Pyongyang uses that time to advance its nuclear capabilities. And uncertainty prevails. It is time to put an end to this vicious cycle. Pyongyang is pursuing two goals at once, a nuclear arsenal and economic development. We know these are incompatible. You cannot have your cake and eat it, too. The leadership in Pyongyang must make no mistake. Security does not come from nuclear weapons. Security comes when the lives of its people are improved. It comes when people are free to pursue their happiness. North Korea must make the right choice. It must walk the path to becoming a responsible member in the community of nations. In order to induce North Korea to make that choice, the international community must speak with one voice. Its message must be clear and consistent. Only then will we see real progress in inter-Korean relations. Only then will lasting peace be brought to the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia. 60 years ago, a stretch of earth bisecting the Korean Peninsula was cleared of arms. Today, that demilitarized zone drawn to prevent armed collision is the most militarized place on the planet. And the standoff around the DMZ has the potential to endanger global peace. We must defuse that danger. Not just South and North Korea. The world must also get involved. The demilitarized zone must live up to its name, a zone that strengthens the peace not undermines it. It is with this vision in mind that I hope to work toward an international park inside the DMZ. It will be a park that sends a message of peace to all of humanity. This could be pursued in parallel with my Trust-building Process. There, I believe we can start to grow peace—to grow trust. It would be a zone of peace bringing together not just Koreans separated by a military line, but also the citizens of the world. I call on America and the global community to join us in seeking the promise of a new day. Honorable members of Congress, The second leg of our journey extends beyond the Korean Peninsula to all of Northeast Asia where we must build a mechanism of peace and cooperation. Sadly, today the nations of this region fail to fulfill all that we can achieve collectively. That potential is tremendous. The region’s economies are gaining ever greater clout and becoming more and more interlinked. Yet, differences stemming from history are widening. It has been said that those who are blind to the past cannot see the future. This is obviously a problem for the here and now. But the larger issue is about tomorrow. For where there is failure to acknowledge honestly what happened yesterday, there can be no tomorrow. Asia suffers from what I call “Asia’s paradox,” the disconnect between growing economic interdependence on the one hand, and backward political, security cooperation on the other. How we manage this paradox—this will determine the shape of a new order in Asia. Together, we must meet these challenges. And so I propose an initiative for peace and cooperation in Northeast Asia. We cannot afford to put off a multilateral dialogue process in Northeast Asia. Together, the United States and other Northeast Asian partners could start with softer issues. These include environmental issues and disaster relief. They include nuclear safety and counter-terrorism. Trust will be built through this process. And that trust will propel us to expand the horizons of our cooperation. The initiative will serve the cause of peace and development in the region. But it will be firmly rooted in the Korea-US alliance. In this sense, it could reinforce President Obama’s strategy of rebalancing towards the Asia-Pacific. Of course, North Korea could also be invited to join. If we start where our interests overlap, then later on it will be easier to find common ground on the larger challenges—easier to find solutions to our mutual benefit. I firmly believe that Korea and the United States will work hand in hand as we shape an emerging process for cooperation in the region. The third and final leg of our journey extends even farther beyond the Peninsula—beyond Northeast Asia to the rest of the world. It is to contribute to happiness—the happiness of Koreans on both halves of the Peninsula—the happiness of all humanity. This is a vision I also advanced at my inauguration. The “Pursuit of Happiness” is enshrined in the American Declaration of Independence. It also occupies a special place in the Korean Constitution. I have long believed that our alliance should aim far —that it should ultimately seek a happier world. Guided by this spirit, we stood side by side in the frontiers of peace and freedom. Infused by this spirit, we are expanding cooperation on global issues like counter-terrorism, nuclear non-proliferation and the global financial crisis. Our efforts will not stop there. Together, we will help spread the universal values of freedom, human rights and the rule of law. We will march together to take on global challenges —from fighting poverty to tackling climate change and other environmental issues. Members of the House and the Senate, Our journey since the Korean War has been led by a specific mission to respond to threats and provocations from the North and to defend freedom and peace on the Korean Peninsula. Today, our alliance is called upon to go beyond that—beyond just the defense of freedom and peace. We are called upon to step forward on a new journey—a journey toward a Korea that is at peace, that is happy, and that is made whole. Our economic partnership must also aim higher and reach further into the future. President Obama has outlined the Startup America Initiative. Together with my strategy for a creative economy, we can advance toward a common goal—to help channel the innovative ideas, the passion, and the drive of our youths towards a brighter future. Koreans and Americans are partnering in new ways whether at world-tours of Korean pop-stars for Hollywood films or at reconstruction sites in the Middle East. Together, we can envision a future that is richer, that is safer, and that is happier. Our chorus of freedom and peace, of future and hope, has not ceased to resonate over the last 60 years and will not cease to go on. Thank you very much.",234,201,0,Republican,45,53,2,Democrat,113
Lee Myung-bak,Republic of Korea,732,10,2011,President,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice-President, distinguished members of Congress, ladies and gentlemen, It is a great privilege to speak to you from this podium, in this great institution representing democracy and freedom. And I am particularly grateful to the leadership of both parties for their hard work in trying to get this agreement passed and to all the esteemed members of Congress for their support, in ratifying the Korea-US free trade agreement last night, in a swift manner which, I am told, was quite unprecedented. I flew halfway round the world to be here today among friends, thinking about and deeply grateful for the friendship between our two countries. For Korea, America is not a distant land. America is our neighbor and our friend. America is our ally and our partner. There is a Korean expression that describes our sixty-year partnership: ""katchikapshida"". In English, it means ""We go together."" Yes. We have been going together for sixty years. For the last sixty years, remarkable changes took place in both of our countries. For the United States, it has been a journey to new frontiers - on this planet and beyond. It has been a journey of achieving fantastic breakthroughs in science and technology which led to the advent of the information age. It was a journey of developing new cures and making advances in machineries. And throughout this journey, you served as the greatest inspiration for peace and prosperity the world has ever known. For the Republic of Korea, the last sixty years has been an incredible time of transformation and renewal. It was an epic journey from poverty to prosperity; from dictatorship to a thriving democracy; from a ""hermit nation"" to a ""global Korea"". Korea's story is your story, too. And that fact is clear in our capital city, Seoul. During the Korean War, Seoul was almost completely destroyed. Today, however, Seoul is reborn. Where there was once rubble now stands the Seoul Tower, looking out over a thriving modern metropolis. In the streets where women and children searched the wreckage for fuel, soon vehicles powered by magnetic strips will roam the streets. Seoul is also the most wired city on the planet. Seoul is also one of the most dynamic and cosmopolitan cities in the world. Last year, Seoul was host to the G20 Summit and next March it will host the second Nuclear Security Summit which will be attended by more than fifty heads of state and government. To mark the 60th anniversary of the Korean War, we invited American veterans back to see the land they helped liberate. And when they visited Korea, they found very few landmarks that they recognized from the war. Instead, they saw in Korea what you see here in the United States today. The pace and the pulse of modern life. A creative entrepreneurial spirit that knows no bounds. A sense of self-confidence, optimism and pride. And an unshakable faith in freedom; in free-elections, a free press and free markets. Ladies and gentlemen, these are the values that we share. Your great president and statesman, Thomas Jefferson, said that the only safe place to locate ""the ultimate powers of the society"" is in the hands of ""the people themselves."" These same values can be found in Korea, too. One of Korea's greatest kings, King Sejong, said 600 years ago that ""The people are heaven. The will of the people is the will of heaven. Revere the people as you would heaven."" Here, an ocean away, in the People's House, these ancient words of our ancestors that calls us to revere our people, still ring true. We also share a belief that political freedom and economic freedom must go hand in hand. During the 1960s, Koreans demanded democracy and freedom. As one of the student leaders who organized protests calling for democracy, I was caught and imprisoned but this only strengthened my conviction that universal rights such as democracy, dignity of man and human rights must never be compromised. At the same time, the Korean people yearned for another kind of freedom - freedom from poverty. Back then, Korea's per capita GDP was less than $80. University graduates roamed the streets, unable to find a job. Opportunities were scarce. It was difficult for people to have hope for the future. This is when I realized that even if we had political freedom and democracy, we would not be truly free without economic freedom. So, after I was released from prison for my political activities, I joined a small local company. This company, which had less than hundred employees at the time, later evolved into a global conglomerate with over 160,000 employees. And as one of its youngest-ever CEOs, I was privileged to be part of Korea's remarkable economic rise as Korea's economy grew into being near the global top ten. Along the way, I was able to escape poverty myself but being able to contribute to my country's growth will always remain one of my proudest moments. As you can see, we have won the fight to win two very important freedoms- our political freedom and our economic freedom. Very few countries were successful in their quest to win freedom from poverty and freedom from oppression. And Koreans are proud of this. And they also know that your friendship - and our alliance - has been indispensible throughout this remarkable journey of hope. And this is why all of you should be proud of what Korea and the Korean people have achieved. Nevertheless, I still get asked by many foreign leaders: how did a country with no natural resources, no technology, no capital and no experience manage to achieve so much in just one generation? My answer to them is simple: the power of education. The Korean War, as I've said, completely destroyed my country. The people had nothing to eat and nothing to wear. For years, we relied on foreign aid. But the Korean people believed in one thing and that was education. Even if parents had to work day and night and drink nothing but water to chase away their hunger, they spared nothing when it came to their children's education. My parents were the same. They were determined to give their children hope by giving them a chance to learn. And I was determined to learn. I used to be a street vendor selling anything and everything during the day and attended night school. After night school, however, going onto college was but a dream; yet, I managed to get in through the help of others. Although I had to wake up every day at 4 am to haul garbage to pay my way through college, I knew that learning was the key. My parents, all Korean parents, believed that education was the best way to break that vicious cycle of poverty. These children later became the lead actors in this great drama. Their sweat and tears is what transformed Korea from being one of the poorest countries in the world to one of the most dynamic today. Our desire for learning continues. Currently, there are more than 100,000 Korean students studying in your schools. These young students will become the leaders of tomorrow; they will become scientists and doctors, bankers and engineers, teachers and artists; they will continue to contribute to making both of our countries stronger. And they will bring our two countries closer together. Distinguished members, Today, the United States and Korea have one of the closest, most important economic relationships in the world. For both countries it has brought untold benefits and opportunities. Our trade in goods, services and mutual investments has grown dramatically. We invest in you - and you invest in us - because we are interdependent. When we trade together, we grow together. When we build together, we rise together. And when we work together, we win together. We see this in the towns and cities and states this Congress represents. We see it in West Point, Georgia, where a new Kia automotive plant is expected to create 1,400 new businesses and more than 20,000 new jobs nearby. We see it in Midland, Michigan, where Dow Chemical, a distinctly American company and Kokam Engineering, a distinctly Korean company, have joined together to make some of the world's most advanced batteries - the building blocks for a new era of electric vehicles. And we have more than 10,000 Korean companies, including global conglomerates such as Samsung and LG, doing business and investing all across America. And we see such cooperation in Korea, as well. Just west of Seoul, a GM Korea joint venture is manufacturing and selling Chevrolets to Korean consumers. Sales are up 27% in just the first six months since the brand was launched. And 55% of Koreans say they would consider buying one. And our cooperation is not just limited to automobiles. Many others, from microchips to biotech, provide similar examples. Our mutual investment is yet another good example. Mr. Speaker, distinguished members of Congress, Thanks to all of you in this chamber, our economic ties are becoming even stronger. The Korea-US Free Trade Agreement was ratified by this Congress here last night. Here, where the Mutual Defense Treaty was signed by Korea and the United States in 1953, a new chapter in our relationship has opened. Our relationship has become stronger. The Korea-US free trade agreement is a historic achievement, a win-win for both countries. This agreement is a major step toward future growth and job creation. It is a win for our corporations. It is a win for our workers. It is a win for small businesses. And it is a win for all the innovators on both sides of the Pacific. Perhaps you have heard what the experts have said: that America's economic output will grow more due to the Korea-US free trade agreement than from America's last nine trade agreements combined. This deal also has fair labor provisions. It has rigorous environmental standards. And it has strong protections for intellectual property rights. These provisions will improve our business environments. These provisions will allow for us to widely share the benefits of trade more than ever. In this century, much has changed but not this basic truth: open markets build strong economies. And in this 21st century, I firmly believe economies must be green to grow. Unfortunately, this was not always our way. For far too long in my country, growth came at a cost. Rapid economic growth cast a dark shadow - in our environment, in the air that we breathed and the water that we drank. This is why when I was mayor of Seoul, I considered it my calling to restore Seoul's Choenggycheon stream which was neglected for decades. The restored stream revitalized the surrounding landscape; revived commercial activity and enriched the lives of the people in countless ways. As president, I announced a new national vision: low carbon green growth. And it is our goal to become the world's seventh-largest green economy by 2020. The benefits of green growth are real. This is why we are investing heavily in the research and development of next-generation power technologies such as the smart grids. This is why we are trying to become the leader in renewable energy sources. This is why we've required our biggest carbon-emitting companies to set greenhouse gas targets this year. They will, of course, work to deliver on their promise. I am aware that the US is also taking measures to ensure a sustainable future. Some of those steps we are taking together. For example, in 2009, our governments signed a statement of intention to work together on renewable energy, energy efficiency and power technologies. The Chicago Smart Building Initiative is a good example of our cooperation. And during my visit this time, our two governments signed a statement of intent on the Joint Research Project on Clean Energy. Joint investments and cooperation will only increase; our work will lead to tangible results that will benefit mankind. As our countries move down this path, we will be moving even closer together. We will move forward together. Distinguished members, ladies and gentlemen, The strength of a country is not measured in dollars alone. Our mutual defense keeps us strong. And it keeps us safe. Ours is an alliance forged in blood. That is how we Koreans describe it. Fifty-eight years ago today in October 1953 here in Washington DC, the Republic of Korea and the United States signed the Mutual Defense Treaty. In the words of that treaty, we pledged our ""common determination to defend (ourselves) against external armed attack so that no potential aggressor could be under the illusion that either of (us) stands alone in the Pacific area."" But, we know that defending freedom is never easy. It is never free of cost or free of risk. For this, I want to thank you. I thank you, on behalf of the Korean people, for standing by us in times of darkness. We also want to thank the 28,500 American men and women in uniform who serve today in Korea. We want to thank you for keeping faith with the generation of your parents and grandparents, defending freedom on the Korean Peninsula. Today, I would also like to thank the Korean War veterans who are here with us today. They are Representatives John Conyers. Charles Rangel. Sam Johnson. And Howard Coble. We thank these gentlemen for their service. Thank you. To these gentlemen and to millions of others, the Korean War or the division of the Korean Peninsula are not abstract concepts. They are not abstract concepts for me, either. My older sister and younger brother, both just children, were killed in that war. I will never forget them. I will never forget how my mother tried so hard to keep them alive. With the war raging all around us, there were no doctors and we couldn't afford to buy medicine. My mother stayed up all night, praying to God. Many Koreans still live with such pain. I recognize the reality that Korea has been split in two. But I will never accept it as a permanent condition. The two Koreas share the same language, history and customs. We are one people. In both Koreas, there are families who have never spoken to their loved ones for more than half a century. My hope is that these people and all 70 million Koreans will enjoy real happiness, real peace. And for this, we must first lay the foundation for peace on the Korean Peninsula. And upon this foundation we must strengthen cooperation between the two Koreas. We must seek the path that will lead us towards mutual prosperity. And we must achieve peaceful unification. A unified Korea will be a friend to all and a threat to none. A unified Korea will contribute to peace and prosperity, not only in Northeast Asia but far beyond. We therefore must achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. And North Korea must give up their nuclear ambitions. Korea and the United States stand united. We are in full agreement that the Six Party Talks is an effective way to achieve tangible progress. We are in full agreement that we must also pursue dialogue with North Korea. However, we must also maintain our principled approach. A North Korea policy that is firmly rooted upon such principles is the key that will allow us to ultimately and fundamentally resolve this issue. North Korea's development is in our collective interest and this is what we want; however, this depends on its willingness to end all provocations and make genuine peace. We will work with you and the international community so that North Korea makes the right choice. Distinguished members, Our mutual defense treaty has ensured stability and prosperity to flourish not only on the Korean Peninsula but across Northeast Asia. Northeast Asia today is a more dynamic region than ever. And economic change in this region brings geopolitical change. It brings shifts in the balance of power that has long prevailed. The United States, as a key player of the Asia-Pacific region and as a global leader, has vital interests in Northeast Asia. For Northeast Asia to play a more constructive role in global affairs there must be peace and stability in the region. And your leadership that has ensured peace and stability of Northeast Asia and beyond in the 20th century, must remain supreme in the 21st century. The ideals that you represent and the leadership that allows for such ideals to become true, must continue. There remain many challenges in the world today and your leadership is vital. Terrorism, proliferation of WMD, climate change, energy security, poverty and disease - these are just a few of the challenges that require your leadership. In this regard, our free trade agreement has significance because it will be a force for stability. Because lasting stability, again, depends on economic opportunity being open and robust. Our relationship can be the catalyst that generates growth all along the Pacific Rim. And in doing so, it will make clear how fully our fates are connected. More than ever, Korea is looking beyond the horizon. It will willingly embrace its international responsibilities. It will work to resolve global challenges. Since becoming President of Korea, my vision for Korea in the coming decades is for a global Korea. Global Korea has joined United Nations peacekeeping operations in East Timor, Lebanon and Haiti. Korea was the third-largest contributor of troops to the coalition forces in Iraq. We have sent reconstruction teams to rebuild Afghanistan. Our naval vessels support the US and EU in fighting against piracy off the coast of Somalia. We will take part in the international effort in bringing democracy to Libya and rebuilding its shattered economy. We have pledged to double our overseas development assistance by 2015. Next month, the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness will be held in Busan, Korea's second-largest city. In these and countless other ways, Korea will carry out its duties as a responsible member of the international community. As we face the many global challenges that lie ahead of us and as we promote universal values, Korea will remain your partner and friend. In 2009 when President Obama and I signed the Joint Vision for the Future of the Alliance, we agreed to work closely together in resolving regional and international issues, based on shared values and mutual trust. During our summit today, we renewed this commitment. We also reaffirmed our commitment to face the challenges of today for the generation of tomorrow. Our alliance will grow and evolve. And it will prevail. Mr. Speaker, distinguished members of Congress, ladies and gentlemen, Before I part, I want to thank you again for the honor of addressing this Congress. I would also like to thank President Obama and Mrs. Obama for their invitation. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the 1.5 million Korean-Americans who have been contributing to this great country. As president of Korea, I am proud that they are giving back to the country that gave them so much. I am also deeply grateful to you and the American people for giving them the chance to make their dreams come true. Your ideals and aspirations have been ours as they have been for much of the world. Half a century ago, young Americans served in the Korean War ""for duty beyond the seas."" Today, our peoples hear the same call. Not always active combat. Not always to brave the rugged mountains or bitter winters. But it is an important duty nonetheless - a charge to help create a more peaceful, more prosperous world. In the 21st century, duty and destiny calls us once again. As before, let us rise to meet the challenges. Let us go together. Together, and forward. God bless you, God bless America. Thank you.",242,193,0,Republican,47,51,2,Democrat,112
Binyamin Netanyahu,State of Israel ,666,5,2011,Prime Minister,"Vice President Biden, Speaker Boehner, Distinguished Senators, Members of the House, honored guests: I'm deeply moved by this warm welcome. And I'm deeply honored that you've given me the opportunity to address Congress a second time. Mr. Vice President, do you remember the time that we were the new kids in town? And I do see a lot of old friends here. And I see a lot of new friends of Israel here as well -- Democrats and Republicans alike. Israel has no better friend than America. And America has no better friend than Israel. We stand together to defend democracy. We stand together to advance peace. We stand together to fight terrorism. Congratulations America. Congratulations, Mr. President. You got bin Laden. Good riddance! In an unstable Middle East, Israel is the one anchor of stability. In a region of shifting alliances, Israel is America’s unwavering ally. Israel has always been pro-American. Israel will always be pro-American. My friends, you don’t have to -- you don't need to do nation building in Israel. We’re already built. You don’t need to export democracy to Israel. We’ve already got it. And you don’t need to send American troops to defend Israel. We defend ourselves. You’ve been very generous in giving us tools to do the job of defending Israel on our own. Thank you all, and thank you President Obama for your steadfast commitment to Israel’s security. I know economic times are tough. I deeply appreciate this. Some of you have been telling me that your belief has been reaffirmed in recent months -- that support for Israel’s security is a wise investment in our common future. For an epic battle is now underway in the Middle East, between tyranny and freedom. A great convulsion is shaking the earth from the Khyber Pass to the Straits of Gibraltar. The tremors have shattered states; they've toppled governments. And we can all see that the ground is still shifting. Now this historic moment holds the promise of a new dawn of freedom and opportunity. There are millions of young people out there who are determined to change their future. We all look at them. They muster courage. They risk their lives. They demand dignity. They desire liberty. These extraordinary scenes in -- in Tunis and Cairo evoke those of Berlin and Prague in 1989. Yet as we share their hopes --You know, I take it as a badge of honor and so should you that in our free societies you can have protests. You can't have these protests in the farcical parliaments in Tehran or in Tripoli. This is real democracy! So as we share the hopes of these young people throughout the Middle East and Iran -- that they'll be able to do what that young woman just did. I think she's young. I couldn't see quite that far -- we also must also remember that those hopes could be snuffed out as they were in Tehran in 1979. You remember what happened then. The brief democratic spring in Tehran was cut short by a ferocious and unforgiving tyranny. And it's this same tyranny that smothered Lebanon’s democratic Cedar Revolution, and inflicted on that long-suffering country, the medieval rule of Hezbollah. So today, the Middle East stands at a fateful crossroads. And like all of you, I pray that the peoples of the region choose the path less travelled, the path of liberty. No one knows what this path consists of better than you. Nobody. This path, of liberty, is not paved by elections alone. It's paved when governments permit protests in town squares, when limits are placed on the powers of rulers, when judges are beholden to laws and not men, and when human rights cannot be crushed by tribal loyalties or mob rule. Israel has always embraced this path, in a Middle East that has long rejected it. In a region where women are stoned, gays are hanged, Christians are persecuted, Israel stands out. It is different. And this was seen --There was a great English writer in the 19th century, George Eliot. It's a she. That was a pseudonym in those days. George Eliot predicted over a century ago, that once established, the Jewish state -- he's what she said -- the Jewish state will ""shine like a bright star of freedom amid the despotisms of the East.” Well, she was right. We have a free press, independent courts, an open economy, rambunctious parliamentary debates. Now, don't laugh. You see, you think you're tough on another -- on one another here in Congress? Come spend a day in the Knesset. Be my guest. Courageous Arab protesters are now struggling to secure these very same rights for their peoples, for their societies. We're proud in Israel that over one million Arab citizens of Israel have been enjoying these rights for decades. Of the 300 million Arabs in the Middle East and North Africa, only Israel’s Arab citizens enjoy real democratic rights. Now, I want you to stop for a second and think about that. Of those 300 million Arabs, less than one-half of one-percent are truly free, and they're all citizens of Israel. This startling fact reveals a basic truth: Israel is not what is wrong about the Middle East. Israel is what is right about the Middle East. Israel fully supports the desire of Arab peoples in our region to live freely. We long for the day when Israel will be one of many real democracies in the -- in the Middle East. Fifteen years ago, I stood at this very podium -- by the way, it hasn't changed -- I stood here and I said that democracy must start to take root in the Arab World. Well, it's begun to take root, and this beginning holds the promise of a brilliant future of peace and prosperity -- because I believe that a Middle East that is genuinely democratic will be a Middle East truly at peace. But while we hope for the best and while we work for the best, we must also recognize that powerful forces oppose this future. They oppose modernity. They oppose democracy. They oppose peace. Foremost among these forces is Iran. The tyranny in Tehran brutalizes its own people. It supports attacks against American troops in Afghanistan and in Iraq. It subjugates Lebanon and Gaza. It sponsors terror worldwide. When I last stood here, I spoke of the consequences of Iran developing nuclear weapons. Now time is running out. The hinge of history may soon turn. For the greatest danger of all could soon be upon us: a militant Islamic regime armed with nuclear weapons. Militant Islam threatens the world. It threatens Islam. Now, I have no doubt -- I'm absolutely convinced -- that it will ultimately be defeated. I believe it will eventually succumb to the forces of freedom and progress. It depends on cloistering young minds for a given amount of years. And the process of opening up information will ultimately defeat this movement. But like other fanaticisms that were doomed to fail, militant Islam could exact an horrific price from all of us before its inevitable demise. A nuclear-armed Iran would ignite a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. It would give terrorists a nuclear umbrella. It would make the nightmare of nuclear terrorism a clear and present danger throughout the world. Now I want you to understand what this means, because if we don't stop it, it's coming. They could put a bomb anywhere. They could put it in a missile. They're working on missiles that could reach this city. They could put it on a -- on a ship inside a container to reach every port. They could eventually put it in a suitcase or in a subway. Now the threat to my country cannot be overstated. Those who dismiss it are sticking their heads in the sand. Less than seven decades after six million Jews were murdered, Iran's leaders deny the Holocaust of the Jewish people, while calling for the annihilation of the Jewish state. Leaders who spew such venom should be banned from every respectable forum on the planet. But there is something that makes the outrage even greater. And you know what this is? It's the lack of outrage. Because in much of the international community, the calls for our destruction are met with utter silence. It's even worse because there are many who rush to condemn Israel for defending itself against Iran’s terror proxies. Not you. Not America. You acted differently. You've condemned the Iranian regime for its genocidal aims. You’ve passed tough sanctions against Iran. History will salute you America! President Obama has said that the United States is determined to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The president successfully led the Security Council at the U.N. to adopt sanctions against Iran. You in Congress passed even tougher sanctions. Now these words and deeds are vitally important, yet the Ayatollah regime briefly suspended its nuclear program only once, in 2003, when it feared the possibility of military action. In that same year, Moammar Gaddafi gave up his nuclear weapons program, and for the same reason. The more Iran believes that all options are on the table, the less the chance of confrontation. And this is why I ask you to continue to send an unequivocal message that America will never permit Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Now as for Israel, if history has taught the Jewish people anything, it is that we must take calls for our destruction seriously. We are a nation that rose from the ashes of the Holocaust. When we say ""never again,"" we mean never again. Israel always reserves -- Israel always reserves the right to defend itself. My friends, while Israel will be ever-vigilant in its defense, we’ll never give up our quest for peace. I guess we’ll give it up when we achieve it. Because we want peace. Because we need peace. Now, we’ve achieved historic peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan, and these have held up for decades. I remember what it was like before we had peace. I was nearly killed in a firefight inside the Suez Canal -- I mean that literally -- inside the Suez Canal. And I was going down to the bottom with a 40-pound pack -- ammunition pack -- on my back, and somebody reached out to grab me. And they’re still looking for the guy who did such a stupid thing. I was nearly killed there. And I remember battling terrorists along both banks of the Jordan. Too many Israelis have lost loved ones, and I know their grief. I lost my brother. So no one in Israel wants a return to those terrible days. The peace with Egypt and Jordan has long served as an anchor of stability and peace in the heart of the Middle East. And this peace -- this peace should be bolstered by economic and political support to all those who remain committed to peace. The peace agreements between Israel and Egypt and Israel and Jordan are vital, but they’re not enough. We must also find a way to forge a lasting peace with the Palestinians. Two years ago, I publicly committed to a solution of two states for two peoples -- a Palestinian state alongside a Jewish state. I’m willing to make painful compromises to achieve this historic peace. As the leader of Israel, it’s my responsibility to lead my people to peace. Now, this is not easy for me. It’s not easy, because I recognize that in a genuine peace, we’ll be required to give up parts of the ancestral Jewish homeland. And you have to understand this: In Judea and Samaria, the Jewish people are not foreign occupiers. We’re not the British in India. We’re not the Belgians in the Congo. This is the land of our forefathers, the land of Israel, to which Abraham brought the idea of one god, where David set out to confront Goliath, and where Isaiah saw his vision of eternal peace. No distortion of history -- and boy am I reading a lot of distortions of history lately, old and new -- no distortion of history could deny the 4,000-year-old bond between the Jewish people and the Jewish land. But there is another truth. The Palestinians share this small land with us. We seek a peace in which they’ll be neither Israel’s subjects nor its citizens. They should enjoy a national life of dignity as a free, viable and independent people living in their own state. They should enjoy a prosperous economy, where their creativity and initiative can flourish. Now, we’ve already seen the beginnings of what is possible. In the last two years, the Palestinians have begun to build a better life for themselves. By the way, Prime Minister Fayyad has led this effort on their part, and I -- I wish him a speedy recovery from his recent operation. We’ve helped -- on our side, we’ve helped the Palestinian economic growth by removing hundreds of barriers and roadblocks to the free flow of goods and people, and the results have been nothing short of remarkable. The Palestinian economy is booming; it’s growing by more than 10 percent a year. And Palestinian cities -- they look very different today than what they looked just a few years -- a few years ago. They have shopping malls, movie theaters, restaurants, banks. They even have e-businesses, but you can’t see that when you visit them. That’s what they have. It’s a great change. And all of this is happening without peace. So imagine what could happen with peace. Peace would herald a new day for both our peoples, and it could also make the dream of a broader Arab-Israeli peace a realistic possibility. So now, here’s the question. You’ve got to ask it: If the benefits of peace with the Palestinians are so clear, why has peace eluded us? Because all six Israeli prime ministers since the signing of the Oslo Accords agreed to establish a Palestinian state, myself included; so why has peace not been achieved? Because so far, the Palestinians have been unwilling to accept a Palestinian state if it meant accepting a Jewish state alongside it. You see, our conflict has never been about the establishment of a Palestinian state; it’s always been about the existence of the Jewish state. This is what this conflict is about. In 1947, the U.N. voted to partition the land into a Jewish state and an Arab state. The Jews said yes; the Palestinians said no. In recent years, the Palestinians twice refused generous offers by Israeli prime ministers to establish a Palestinian state on virtually all the territory won by Israel in the Six Day War. They were simply unwilling to end the conflict. And I regret to say this: They continue to educate their children to hate. They continue to name public squares after terrorists. And worst of all, they continue to perpetuate the fantasy that Israel will one day be flooded by the descendants of Palestinian refugees. My friends, this must come to an end. President Abbas must do what I have done. I stood before my people -- and I told you, it wasn’t easy for me -- I stood before my people and I said, “I will accept a Palestinian state.” It’s time for President Abbas to stand before his people and say, “I will accept a Jewish state.” Those six words will change history. They’ll make it clear to the Palestinians that this conflict must come to an end; that they’re not building a Palestinian state to continue the conflict with Israel, but to end it. And those six words will convince the people of Israel that they have a true partner for peace. With such a partner, the Palestinian -- or rather the Israeli people will be prepared to make a far-reaching compromise. I will be prepared to make a far-reaching compromise. This compromise must reflect the dramatic demographic changes that have occurred since 1967. The vast majority of the 650,000 Israelis who live beyond the 1967 lines reside in neighborhoods and suburbs of Jerusalem and Greater Tel Aviv. Now these areas are densely populated, but they’re geographically quite small. And under any realistic peace agreement, these areas, as well as other places of critical strategic and national importance, we’d -- be incorporated into the final borders of Israel. The status of the settlements will be decided only in negotiations, but we must also be honest. So I’m saying today something that should be said publicly by all those who are serious about peace. In any real peace agreement, in any peace agreement that ends the conflict, some settlements will end up beyond Israel’s borders. Now the precise delineation of those borders must be negotiated. We’ll be generous about the size of the future Palestinian state. But as President Obama said, the border will be different than the one that existed on June 4th, 1967. Israel will not return to the indefensible boundaries of 1967. So I want to be very clear on this point. Israel will be generous on the size of a Palestinian state but will be very firm on where we put the border with it. This is an important principle, shouldn’t be lost. We recognize that a Palestinian state must be big enough to be viable, to be independent, to be prosperous. All of you -- and the president too -- have referred to Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people, just as you’ve been talking about a future Palestinian state as the homeland of the Palestinian people. Well, Jews from around the world have a right to immigrate to the one and only Jewish state, and Palestinians from around the world should have a right to immigrate, if they so choose, to a Palestinian state. And here is what this means. It means that the Palestinian refugee problem will be resolved outside the borders of Israel. You know, everybody knows this. It’s time to say it. It’s important. And as for Jerusalem, only a democratic Israel has protected the freedom of worship for all faiths in the city. Throughout the millennial history of the Jewish capital, the only time that Jews, Christians and Moslems could worship freely, could have unfettered access to their holy sites has been during Israel’s sovereignty over Jerusalem. Jerusalem must never again be divided. Jerusalem must remain the united capital of Israel. I know this is a difficult issue for Palestinians. But I believe that, with creativity and with good will, a solution can be found. So this is the peace I plan to forge with a Palestinian partner committed to peace. But you know very well that in the Middle East, the only peace that will hold is the peace you can defend. So peace must be anchored in security. In recent years, Israel withdrew from south Lebanon and from Gaza. We thought we’d get peace. That’s not what we got. We got 12,000 rockets fired from those areas on our cities, on our children, by Hezbollah and Hamas. The U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon, they failed to prevent the smuggling of this weaponry. The European observers in Gaza, they evaporated overnight. So if Israel simply walked out of the territories, the flow of weapons into a future Palestinian state would be unchecked, and missiles fired from it could reach virtually every home in Israel in less than a minute. I want you to think about that, too. Imagine there’s a siren going on now and we have less than 60 seconds to find shelter from an incoming rocket. Would you live that way? Do you think anybody can live that way? Well, we’re not going to live that way either. The truth is that Israel needs unique security arrangements because of its unique size. It’s one of the smallest countries in the world. Mr. Vice President, I’ll grant you this: It’s bigger than Delaware. It’s even bigger than Rhode Island. But that’s about it. Israel under 1967 lines would be half the width of the Washington Beltway. Now, here’s a bit of nostalgia. I came to Washington 30 years ago as a young diplomat. It took me a while, but I finally figured it out: there is an America beyond the Beltway. But Israel under 1967 lines would be only nine miles wide. So much for strategic depth. So it’s therefore vital -- absolutely vital -- that a Palestinian state be fully demilitarized, and it’s vital -- absolutely vital -- that Israel maintain a long-term military presence along the Jordan River. Solid security arrangements on the ground are necessary not only to protect the peace; they’re necessary to protect Israel in case the peace unravels, because in our unstable region, no one can guarantee that our peace partners today will be there tomorrow. And my friends, when I say ""tomorrow,"" I don’t mean some distant time in the future; I mean tomorrow. Peace can only be achieved around the negotiating table. The Palestinian attempt to impose a settlement through the United Nations will not bring peace. It should be forcefully opposed by all those who want to see this conflict end. I appreciate the president’s clear position on these -- on this issue. Peace cannot be imposed. It must be negotiated. But peace can only be negotiated with partners committed to peace, and Hamas is not a partner for peace. Hamas -- Hamas remains committed to Israel’s destruction and to terrorism. They have a charter. That charter not only calls for the obliteration of Israel, it says: Kill the Jews everywhere you find them. Hamas’ leader condemned the killing of Osama bin Laden and praised him as a holy warrior. Now, again, I want to make this clear: Israel is prepared to sit down today and negotiate peace with the Palestinian Authority. I believe we can fashion a brilliant future for our children. But Israel will not negotiate with a Palestinian government backed by the Palestinian version of al-Qaeda. That we will not do. So I say to President Abbas: Tear up your pact with Hamas! Sit down and negotiate. Make peace with the Jewish state. And if you do, I promise you this: Israel will not be the last country to welcome a Palestinian state as a new member of the United Nations; it will be the first to do so. My friends, the momentous trials over the last century and the unfolding events of this century attest to the decisive role of the United States in defending peace and advancing freedom. Providence entrusted the United States to be the guardian of liberty. All people who cherish freedom owe a profound debt of gratitude to your great nation. Among the most grateful nations is my nation, the people of Israel, who have fought for their liberty and survival against impossible odds in ancient and modern times alike. I speak on behalf of the Jewish people and the Jewish state when I say to you, representatives of America: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your unwavering support for Israel. Thank you for ensuring that the flame of freedom burns bright throughout the world. May God bless all of you, and may God forever bless the United States of America.",242,193,0,Republican,47,51,2,Democrat,112
Julia Gillard,Commonwealth of Australia,900,3,2011,Prime Minister,"Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. President pro tempore, distinguished members of the Senate and the House, distinguished guests, ladies, and gentlemen: I'm the fourth Australian Prime Minister to address you. Like them, I take your invitation as a great honor. Like them, I accepted on behalf of Australia. Since 1950 Australian Prime Ministers, Robert Menzies, Bob Hawke, and John Howard have come here, speaking for all the Australian people, through you to all the people of the United States. They each came with a simple message. A message which has been true in war and peace. A message which has been true in hardship and prosperity, in the cold war and in the new world. A message I repeat to you today. Distinguished members of the Senate and the House, you have a true friend down under. For my parents' generation, the defining image of America was the landing at Normandy. Your boys of Pronta Ho risking everything to help free the world. For my own generation, the defining image of America was the landing on the moon. My classmates and I were sent home from school to watch the great moment on television. I always remember thinking that day, Americans can do anything. Americans helped free the world of my parents' generation. Americans inspired the world of my own youth. I stand here and I see before me, the very same brave and free people. I believe you can do anything still. There is a reason the world always looks to America. Your great dream, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness inspires us all. Those of you who have spent time with Australians know that we're not given to over statement. By nature, we're laconic speakers and by conviction we are realistic thinkers. In both of our countries, real mates talk straight. We mean what we say. So let me say this to you. You have an ally in Australia, an ally for war and peace, an ally for hardship and prosperity, an ally for the sixty years past, and Australia is also an ally for all of the years to come. Geography and history alone could never explain the strength of the commitment between us. Rather our values are shared and our people are friends. This is the heart of our alliance. This is why in our darkest days, we've been glad, glad to see each other's face and hear each other's voice. Australia's darkest days in the last century followed the fall of Singapore in 1942 and you were there with us. Under attack in the Pacific, we fought together, side by side, step by bloody step. And whilst it was Australian soldiers and Milne Bay who gave at the allies our first victory on land in the Pacific war, it was American sailors at the Battle of the Coral Sea destroyed the fear of an invasion of Australia. Distinguished members of the Senate and the House, Australia does not forget. We will never forget. The ultimate expression of our alliance, the ANZUS Treaty was not signed until 1951. But it was anticipated a decade earlier in the judgments, the clear, frank and accurate judgments of an Australian Prime Minister, and in the resolve, the extraordinary, immovable resolve of an American President. In the decades since, we've stuck together in every major conflict, from Korea and Vietnam, to the conflicts in the Gulf. Your darkest days since Pearl Harbor were ten years ago in Washington and New York and we were with you. My predecessor John Howard was quite literally with you and he came to this Capitol when you met on September 12 to show you that Australians would be with you again. And after fifty years under a new Prime Minister and a new President, the ANZUS Treaty was invoked. Within Australia's democracy, John Howard and I had our differences, but he was and is an Australian patriot, a man who was moved by what he saw here in that terrible September. He was and is a friend of America. When John Howard addressed you here in 2002, we were already with you in Afghanistan and we are with you there still. I want you to know what I've told Australia's Parliament in Canberra, what I told General Petraeus in Kabul, what I told President Obama in the Oval Office this week. Australia will stand firm with our ally, the United States. Friends -- Friends understand this, that we will stand firm with you. But perhaps more importantly, our enemies understand this too. We must be very realistic about Afghanistan's future. Australia firmly supports the international strategy led by President Obama and adopted in Lisbon last year. Australia is doing our part, in Uruzgan province in particular and across the whole of Afghanistan. The government of Afghanistan must play its part too. We know transition will take some years. We must not transition out only to transition back in. We must not. From my discussions with your country's leaders in Washington, my meetings with generals in Afghanistan, and my time with our troops, this is my conclusion. I believe we have the right strategy in place, a resolute and courageous commander in General Petraeus and the resources needed to deliver the strategy. I am cautiously encouraged by what I have seen. For a moment I want you to see Afghanistan through the eyes of Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith. Ben is Australia's most recent Victoria Cross winner, our equivalent of your Medal of Honor. Ben is a veteran of five tours of Afghanistan and first went there in 2006. When we met recently his words to me were compelling. He said it's not the same country I first went to five years ago. We are making a difference. Friends, there are hard days ahead. I flew to your country the day after attending the funeral of a young Australian who served in Afghanistan, Sapper Jamie Larcombe was from my home state of South Australia, from a small community with the most perfectly Australian name, Kangaroo Island. Jamie's life's ambition was to serve his country. He was a long way from Kangaroo Island when he made the ultimate sacrifice. We will remember. I know very many -- very many young Americans have served their country and lost their lives in Afghanistan too. As a friend, we share your grief. As an ally, we share your resolve. Afghanistan must never again be a safe haven for terrorism. Just as our security alliance is one for war and peace, our economic partnership is one for hardship and prosperity. In hard days, we work together. Our societies share a deep understanding of the importance of work. We believe life is given purpose and direction by work. Without work there is corrosive aimlessness. With the loss of work comes the loss of dignity. That's why in each of our countries, the great goal of all we do in the economy is the same. That great goal is to ensure that everyone who can work, does work. In turn, this is why each of our countries took early and strong action in the face of the greatest threat to the world's economy since the Great Depression. And we did not just act locally or individually, we worked hard together, when, we worked together when hardship came. It was difficult but we did it together. New global realities and the emerging economic weight of countries like China, India, and Brazil meant the vital forum for the global response was the leaders of the G-20 nations. My predecessor, Kevin Rudd worked hard to ensure this was so. The world needed a global response to the economic crisis and global leadership was vital. Together the G-20 coordinated five trillion dollars in fiscal stimulus for the global economy. While there has been very real pain, the global response averted true economic disaster. Economic stimulus has been crucial to limit the worst effects of the downturn. Economic reform is crucial now to deliver the best hopes for a strong recovery. Like you, I'm a leader in a democracy. I know reform is never easy, but I know reform is right. The general economic outlook remains fragile and uncertain. Global economic balances persist and we must address them or risk future instability. Your leadership in the G-20 is still needed to ensure we make the reforms which will keep the global economy on the path to strong, sustained, and balanced growth. And that is the path to growth in America as well. We worked hard with you during the global economic crisis to resist protectionist pressures. This only built on our decades working together to promote free trade in the world. I know many of you worked hard to achieve the Australia-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. Can I say to each of you today, thank you. Our free trade agreement shows the benefits of free trade and we aim for even -- even larger benefits from the trans-Pacific partnership, which is a great economic opportunity for our two countries and seven of our regional partners. And we have other opportunities to promote trade and jobs as well. I'm looking forward to your country hosting the APEC Leaders' meeting later this year. We will work closely together there. Australia is also working for an ambitious and balanced conclusion of the WTO Doha Round as soon as possible. And we look forward to your Congress passing a 2012 farm bill that advances free trade rather than distorting it, and through free trade, creates jobs. We know the equation is simple. Trade equals jobs, a very simple equation. Our societies share a deep understanding of the importance of work and our societies share a deep commitment to the value of education. We understand education's transformative power. We know education is the future for every child who learns. We also know education is the future for our economies. Our future growth relies on competitiveness and innovation, skills and productivity and these in term rely on the education of our people. Australia and America are partners in a globalized world where open societies flourish and competitive economies thrive. That's why I went to a school in Wakefield, Virginia with President Obama this week. The President and I not only saw children learning, we saw the future of your people, and the future of your prosperity as well. Australians are deeply grateful to your greatest generation for their mighty deeds. This week I've seen a new generation of Americans. I genuinely believe they can be greater still. Achieving prosperity while sharing its benefits requires farsighted educational reforms. In the same way, achieving growth while caring for our climate requires farsighted economic reforms. Breaking the link between economic growth and emissions growth is a difficult challenge for our economies and we can only achieve it by working together. Our cooperation in key international forums and in research and development is making an important contribution. We must work together to achieve an historic transition to high technology, high skill, clean energy economies. Shared values are the basis of our security alliance and shared values are the basis of our economic partnership as well. Through hard work and education we can deliver a strong economy and opportunity for all. Americans are great optimists and Australians will always have a go. So conceived in the Pacific war and born in the Cold War, adapted to the Space Age, and invoked in the face of terror, our indispensable alliance is a friendship for the future. It is this year, the sixtieth anniversary of the signing of our treaty. It is because of that I have the opportunity to speak to you today. For that, I'm grateful. As I said to President Obama, it is an alliance sixty years young with so much future to share, and this is a timely opportunity, not so much for reflection on the past as the discussion of our future. The bipolar world in which our alliance was signed has long since disappeared. I'm not sad about its passing. Hundreds of millions of people have a better life today. Democracy and human dignity have spread wide in the world in the last twenty years. We've seen this from Eastern Europe to East Asia in recent years and we are seeing the hope of it in the Middle East right now. We understand that nothing is certain. There is still much for the people of the Middle East to do. And the governments of the world will be called on to help them do it. Yet I believe what we are seeing is unchanging realities of human nature finding a new expression in a new way. For Australia's part we will do what we can and work with you to support orderly transitions to democracy, to foster human rights and religious freedom within the countries of the Middle East, and to secure a lasting peace between them, a peace where no nation threatens another, which is why we join you in condemning Iran's nuclear program. And we also strive for peace, a peace where Israel is secure and where Palestinians have a state of their own, which is why we join you in calling on all parties to negotiate in good faith. Our alliance was signed sixty years ago in the Cold War and it lives in a new world today. And momentous as the changes in the Middle East are, I believe it is in the Asia Pacific where the global order is changing the most. We admire India's example as a true democracy. We never forget Indonesia's transition to create the world's third largest democracy in the world's largest Islamic country. And we applaud China's lifting some five hundred million people out of poverty. The center of global strategic and economic weight is shifting to this region. The rise of the Asia Pacific will define our times. Like you, our relationship with China is important and complex. We encourage China to engage as a good global citizen. And we are clear-eyed about where differences do lie. My guiding principle is that prosperity can be shared. We can create wealth together. The global economy is not a zero-sum gain. There is no reason for Chinese prosperity to detract from prosperity in Australia, the United States, or any where in the world. America has always understood this principle of the economy, that everyone can benefit when everyone competes. And for sixty years your leadership in the Asia Pacific has showed this. Your commitment to free trade and investment fueled the growth. Your presence and network of allies ensured the stability. You were indispensable in the Cold War and you are indispensable in the new world too. So, your growing engagement with key countries in the region like Japan, India, South Korea, and Indonesia is enormously welcome. We will work closely with you to strengthen the fabric of these relationships and underpin regional stability. Strengthening regional institutions so that the countries of the Asia Pacific increasingly manage the frictions of a growing and changing Asia Pacific. That's why your nation's decision to join the East Asia Summit is such good news. The Summit brings the leaders of the region's major powers together and has a mandate to deal with the whole range of economic, political, and security issues our countries face. Our relationship is evolving to meet these new challenges from defense and intelligence, to diplomacy and trade. Australia in the south, with South Korea and Japan to the north, form real Asia Pacific partnerships with the United States, anchors of regional stability. An alliance which was strong in the Cold War. An alliance which is strong in the new world. In both of our countries, true friends stick together. Our nations do this and our people do this as well. Nothing better tells this truth than the story of two firefighters. Many Australians and Americans worked together in the late 1990s to be ready to protect the 2000 Sydney Olympics from possible terrorist attack. One group of Australians spent two months in New York training and working, including a long time with New York's Fire Department Rescue One. They worked hard together and became more than colleagues. They became mates. So when it was time to go home, the Australian commander gave Rescue One's chief his Australian army's slouch hat. And the chief presented the Australians with a battle-scarred fire helmet dated December 19, '98 and signed by members of the Rescue One crew including Kevin Dowdell. Three years later Kevin Dowdell was one of the hundreds of New York firefighters killed when the towers came down. Kevin led his men in. His remains were never found. But that helmet was in Australia and Aussie firefighter, Rob Frey found Kevin's sons. James Dowdell is one of New York's bravest, a firefighter like his father before him. Patrick Dowdell is wearing his country's uniform in Afghanistan. Rob came to America to give James the helmet his father signed, a precious possession, a last link to a father lost. And I give you their story, a precious possession too. These two men are here today, Rob, James good on you. Rob, James we are so proud of what you represent. Your story says it all, about the friendship between Australia and the United States, together in the hardest of times, friends for the future. When our alliance was signed sixty years ago, the challenges of the Space Age were still to come. The challenges of terrorism was still to come. For sixty years, leaders from Australia and the United States have looked inside themselves and found the courage, the courage to face those challenges. And after sixty years we do the same today, to protect our peoples, to share our prosperity, to safeguard our future. For ours is a friendship for the future. It has been from its founding and it remains so today. You have a friend in Australia and you have an ally and we know what that means. In both our countries, true friends stick together. In both our countries, real mates talk straight. So as a friend, I urge you only this. Be worthy to your own best traditions. Be bold. In 1942 John Curtin, my predecessor, my country's great wartime leader looked to America. I still do. This year you mark the centenary of President Regan's birth. He remains a great symbol of American optimism. The only greater symbol of American optimism is America itself. The eyes of the world are still upon you. Your city on a hill cannot be hidden. Your brave and free people have made you the masters of recovery and reinvention. As I stand before you in this, this cradle of democracy I see a nation that changed the world, a nation that has known remarkable days. I firmly believe you are the same people who amazed me when I was a small girl by landing on the moon. On that great day, I believed Americans could do anything. I believe that still. You can do anything. Thank you.",242,193,0,Republican,47,51,2,Democrat,112
Felipe Calderon Hinojosa,Mexico ,70,5,2010,President,"It is a great honor to stand before you today. I would like to thank Congress and the American People for this invitation. I want to express my gratitude to all of you here who have supported Mexico during very challenging times. I also salute the Mexican Americans and all Latinos who work every day for the prosperity of this great nation. Mexico is a young country but a very old nation. Our roots go back thousands of years. However, this year is especially significant for us. We are celebrating the Bicentennial of our Independence, two hundred years of being proudly free and proudly Mexican. At that time, Mexico was the first nation to abolish slavery in the whole of continental America. And it is exactly one hundred years since the Mexican Revolution, a revolution against oppression, a revolution for justice and democracy. As you can see, Mexico was founded on the same values and principles as the United States of America. We are very proud of this past. However, the Mexican people and their government are focused on the future. That is why Mexico is a country in a continuous process of transformation. We are determined to change, and we are taking the decisions that are going to make Mexico a more prosperous democracy. One of the main changes taking place in Mexico is our commitment to firmly establish the rule of law. That is why we are deploying the full force of the State to confront organized crime with determination and courage. Let me be clear, this fight is not only and not mainly about stopping the drug trade. It is first and foremost a drive to guarantee the security of Mexican families, who are under threat from the abuses and the vicious acts of criminals. I told the Mexican people in my inaugural speech, restoring public security will not be easy and will not be quick. It will take time; it will take money and, unfortunately, to our deep sorrow, human lives as well. This is a battle that has to be fought, because the future of our families is at stake. But, I told them, you can be sure of one thing. This is a battle that, united, we the Mexican people will win. We cannot ignore the fact that the challenge to our security has roots on both sides of the border. At the end of the day its origin is the high demand for drugs here. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said ""We accept our share of the responsibility. We know that the demand for drugs drives much of this illicit trade."" This is symbolic of our new relationship. We have moved from the suspicion and the mutual recrimination of the past to the cooperation and mutual understanding of the present. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate President Obama for his recent initiative to reduce the consumption of drugs. I hope, for the good of both nations and the entire hemisphere, that this succeeds. Now let me tell you what Mexico is doing to confront and overcome this problem. First, we have not hesitated to use all the power of the state, including the federal police and the Armed Forces, in order to support the local governments that are facing the greatest threat from organized crime. This is a temporary measure to restore order. The goal is to provide local governments with time and opportunity to rebuild and strengthen their security and judicial institutions. Second, we are weakening the financial and operational capabilities of criminal gangs. Federal operations have led to record seizures of drugs, cash and weapons from the criminals. We are hitting them and hitting them hard. The Federal Forces have also arrested many important felons who are now facing Mexican justice. And we have extradited a record number of criminals to face justice in the United States. Third, we are rebuilding our institutions and security forces, especially at the federal level. We have more than tripled the federal police budget since the beginning of my Administration and multiplied the size of its force. We are recruiting honest young men and women with values, who are better trained, better paid and better equipped. Fourth, we are transforming our judicial system to make it more transparent and efficient. We are moving towards open and oral trials that are the basis of your own judicial system. And fifth, we have set up social programs to prevent young people from turning to crime, including prevention and treatment for addictions. As you can see, Mexico is doing everything it can to fight this threat and to secure our common future. We are fulfilling our duty as a good neighbor, taking care of business on our side of the border. The U.S. is also helping. Congress approved the Merida Initiative, which we greatly appreciate, and our Administrations are sharing more information than ever to fight crime. However, there is one issue where Mexico needs your cooperation. And that is stopping the flow of assault weapons and other deadly arms across the border. I fully respect the American Constitution. And I understand that the purpose of the Second Amendment is to guarantee good American citizens the ability to defend themselves and their nation. But believe me, many of these guns are not going to honest American hands. Instead thousands are ending up in the hands of criminals. Just to give you an idea, we have seized 75 thousand guns and assault weapons in Mexico in the last three years, and more than 80 percent of those we have been able to trace came from the United States. And if you look carefully, you will notice that the violence started to grow a couple of years before I took office in 2006. This coincides with the lifting of the Assault Weapons Ban in 2004. One day criminals in Mexico, having gained access to these weapons, decided to challenge the authorities in my country. Today, these weapons are aimed by the criminals not only at rival gangs, but also at Mexican civilians and authorities. And with all due respect if you do not regulate the sale of these weapons in the right way, nothing guarantees that criminals here in the United States, with access to the same weapons, will not in turn decide to point them at US authorities and citizens. It is true that the U.S. Government is now carrying out operations against gun traffickers. But it is also true that there are more than seven thousand gun shops along the border with Mexico, where almost anyone can purchase these powerful weapons. I also fully understand the political sensitivity of this issue. But I would ask Congress to help us, and to understand how important it is for us that you enforce current laws to stem the supply of these weapons to criminals, and consider reinstating the Assault Weapons Ban. Let us work together to end this lethal trade that threatens Mexico and your own people. I have spoken at length on this issue, because I know it is a big concern of the American people. However, as I said, Mexico is a country undergoing deep transformations, and our relationship is about much more than just security. We are turning our economy into one that is competitive and strong, capable of generating the jobs Mexicans need. We are carrying out a set of structural reforms that had been ignored for decades. We started by reforming the public pension system, and with this we guaranteed the retirement of public servants and at the same time we will save 30 points of GDP at net present value in our public finances. We passed a tax reform that reduced our dependence on oil and allowed us to continue financing our development, keeping our public deficit close to 1% of GDP. We also made important changes to the oil sector. This will allow Pemnex to award more flexible contracts to specialized global companies and so become more efficient and increase its operational and financial capacity. This will ensure our energy independence and strengthen regional energy security as well. And, finally, we have increased investment in infrastructure from three to five percent of GDP, building the roads, ports, airports, and energy plants we need to modernize. This is the highest investment level in infrastructure in decades. These changes are making us a more modern country and a stronger partner of the United States. The energy reform, the fiscal reform, the pension reform, the investment in infrastructure, have all prepared us for a better tomorrow, but also allowed us to overcome the terrible economic crisis last year. Then, Mexico's economy experienced its worst contraction in modern times. However, thanks to strong regulations not one cent from taxpayers went to a single bank in Mexico. We were also able to quickly implement counter-cyclical measures such as a temporary public works program and increased credits for small businesses. In this way we were able to save hundreds of thousands of jobs. We managed this even though we had to face a series of emergencies, any one of which would have derailed a weaker country. We overcame the second worst drought in seventy years; the biggest ever drop in oil production; and the outbreak of the H1N1 flu virus. So today I can come here before you and say with confidence that Mexico is standing tall, a stronger and more determined nation than ever. A nation and a people ready to face the future and take their rightful place in the world. And the future starts now, now that the Mexican economy is recovering. So far this year, Mexico has created more than 400,000 new jobs, the highest number ever created in a four month period. In the first quarter, the Mexican economy grew 4.3 percent and we are expecting to grow more than 4 percent this year, which means, among other things, more wellbeing for our people and more Mexicans buying more American products. We have made structural reforms to modernize our economy and we want more. Today, our Congress is debating stronger anti-trust regulation as well as new labor legislation that will provide more opportunities for women and young people. And my government is auctioning both wireless frequencies and an optic fiber backbone in order to increase competition and coverage in telecoms. Mexico is on the right track towards development. As well as promoting economic progress, we are improving the quality of life of all Mexicans, under the principle of equal opportunities for all. Thanks to ""Oportunidades"", an advanced poverty relief program, Mexico was able to reduce the number of people living in extreme poverty from 35 to 14 million between 1996 and 2006. This program reaches the six million poorest families, which means one in four Mexicans. Equal opportunity means more and better education and we have provided scholarships to six million poor children of all ages. At the same time we are investing more than ever in free public universities. And today, almost 90 thousand students graduate as engineers and technicians every year. Equal opportunity means access to health services for everyone. We have tripled the budget for Popular Health Insurance and rebuilt or renovated 1,700 public hospitals in three years. This will allow us to reach a goal any nation would be proud of, universal health coverage by 2012. A doctor, medicine and treatment for any Mexican that needs it. Equal opportunity means more and better education, cutting- edge poverty fighting programs, and universal health coverage. By improving opportunities for all, we are giving people one less reason to leave Mexico. As you can see, Mexico is a country in transformation. This is making us an even more strategic partner for the future prosperity of the American people. The world is more global and more interconnected every day. It is also divided into large economic regions. Those regions that maximize their comparative advantages will be the ones that succeed. And we both need to compete with Asia and with Europe. Mexico and the United States are stronger together than they are apart. Our economic ties have made both economies stronger, and together we can renew our partnership to restore stronger and faster economic growth. A stronger Mexico means a stronger United States. Let us not forget, Mexicans are the second largest foreign buyers of American goods. And a stronger United States, of course, means a stronger Mexico. So I invite you to work with Mexico and consolidate North America as the most competitive region in the world. Let us create more jobs for American workers, and more jobs for Mexican workers. Members of Congress, I am not a President who likes to see Mexicans leave our country searching for opportunities abroad. With migration, our communities lose their best people: the hardest working, the most dynamic, the leaders. Each migrant is a parent who will never see his children again. I want to tell the migrants, those who are working here for the greatness of this country, that we admire them, that we miss them, that we are fighting for their rights and that we are working hard for Mexico and for its families. Today, we are doing the best that we can do in order to reduce migration: to create opportunities and to create jobs for Mexicans in our own country, where their homes are, where their families are. As many jobs as we can. And Mexico will one day be a country in which its people will find the opportunities that today they look for outside the country. Until then, Mexico is determined to assume its responsibility. For us migration is not just your problem. We see it as our problem as well. My government does not favor the breaking of rules. I fully respect the right of any country to enact and enforce its own laws. But what we need today is to fix a broken system. We favor the establishment of laws that work, and work well for us all. So the time has come for the United States and Mexico to work together on this issue. The time has come to reduce the causes of migration, and to turn this phenomenon into one of legal, ordered and secure flows of workers and visitors. I want to recognize the hard work and leadership of many in the Senate and the House, and of President Obama, who are determined to find responsible and objective answers to this issue. I am convinced that a comprehensive immigration reform is also crucial to securing our common border. However, I strongly disagree with the recently adopted law in Arizona. It is a law that not only ignores a reality that cannot be erased by decree, but also introduces a terrible idea, using racial profiling as a basis for law enforcement. And that is why I agree with President Obama who said the new law ''carries a great amount of risk when core values that we all care about are breached."" We cannot ignore this threat to civil rights and democracy, two core values that we share; we must find a better way to face and fix together this common problem. And finally, the well being of both our peoples depends not only on our ability to face regional challenges but global ones as well. That is the case of climate change. This is one of humanity's more pressing threats. It demands the commitment of all nations both developed and developing. That is why Mexico was the first developing country to commit to emissions reduction targets. As host of the upcoming COP 16, we are working hard to make progress in the fight against climate change. Because of your global leadership, we will need your support to make the meeting in Cancun next November a success. Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, honorable members of the United States Congress. Mexico is a country in deep transformation; we are building the future our people deserve, a future of opportunity, of freedom, of equality; a future of security, in which families and children can go out to work, study and play without fear. And, most of all, a future in which our children and their children will see their dreams come true. I have come here as your partner and as your friend. Our two great nations are joined by geography and by history, as well as by a shared brilliant future. I believe in the future of North America as the strongest, most prosperous region in the world. President Franklin D. Roosevelt once said that ""the only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today. Let us move forward with strong and active faith."" Let us work together in order to give our peoples the future they deserve. Thank you very much for your invitation.",178,257,0,Democrat,41,57,2,Democrat,111
Angela Merkel,Federal Republic of Germany,255,11,2009,Chancellor,"Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Distinguished Members of Congress, I would like to thank you for the great honor and privilege to address you today, shortly before the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. I am the second German chancellor on whom this honor has been bestowed. The first was Konrad Adenauer when he addressed both Houses of Congress in 1957, albeit one after the other. Our lives could not have been more different. In 1957 I was just a small child of three years. I lived with my parents in Brandenburg, a region that belonged to the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the part of Germany that was not free. My father was a Protestant pastor. My mother, who had studied English and Latin to become a teacher, was not allowed to work in her chosen profession in the GDR. In 1957 Konrad Adenauer was already 81 years old. He had lived through the German Empire, the First World War, the Weimar Republic and the Second World War. The National Socialists ousted him from his position as mayor of the city of Cologne. After the war, he was among the men and women who helped build up the free, democratic Federal Republic of Germany. Nothing is more symbolic of the Federal Republic of Germany than its constitution, the Basic Law, or Grundgesetz. It was adopted exactly 60 years ago. Article 1 of the Grundgesetz proclaims, and I quote, “Human dignity shall be inviolable.” This short, simple sentence – “Human dignity shall be inviolable” – was the answer to the catastrophe that was the Second World War, to the murder of six million Jews in the Holocaust, to the hate, destruction and annihilation that Germany brought upon Europe and the world. November 9th is just a few days away. It was on November 9, 1989 that the Berlin Wall fell and it was also on November 9 in 1938 that an indelible mark was branded into Germany’s memory and Europe’s history. On that day the National Socialists destroyed synagogues, setting them on fire, and murdered countless people. It was the beginning of what led to the break with civilization, the Shoah. I cannot stand before you today without remembering the victims of this day and of the Shoah. And I cannot stand before you today without mentioning how grateful I am for the presence of one guest, who personally experienced the horror of National Socialism in Germany and whom I recently met personally: Professor Fritz Stern. He was born in 1926 in what was then the German city of Breslau and today is the Polish city of Wroclaw. He and his family were able to escape the Nazi regime in 1938 and flee to the United States. In his autobiography, published in 2006 under the title Five Germanys I Have Known, Fritz Stern describes the moment of his arrival in New York’s harbor in 1938, a haven of freedom and security. Ladies and gentlemen, it is wonderful that history willed that we should both – the twelve-year-old boy who was driven out of Germany and me, the Chancellor of reunited Germany who was born in the GDR – be here in this distinguished House. This fills me with great joy and deep gratitude. Not even in my wildest dreams could I have imagined, twenty years ago before the Wall fell, that this would happen. It was beyond imagination then to even think about traveling to the United States of America let alone standing here today. The land of unlimited opportunity – for a long time it was impossible for me to reach. The Wall, barbed wire and the order to shoot those who tried to leave limited my access to the free world. So I had to create my own picture of the United States from films and books, some of which were smuggled in from the West by relatives. What did I see and what did I read? What was I passionate about? I was passionate about the American dream — the opportunity for everyone to be successful, to make it in life through their own personal effort. I, like many other teenagers, was passionate about a certain brand of jeans that were not available in the GDR and which my aunt in West Germany regularly sent to me. I was passionate about the vast American landscape which seemed to breathe the very spirit of freedom and independence. Immediately in 1990 my husband and I traveled for the first time in our lives to America, to California. We will never forget our first glimpse of the Pacific Ocean. It was simply gorgeous. I was passionate about all of these things and much more, even though until 1989 America was simply out of reach for me. And then, on November 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall came down. The border that for decades had divided a nation into two worlds was now open. And that is why for me today is, first of all, the time to say thank you. I thank the American and Allied pilots who heard and heeded the desperate call of Berlin’s mayor Ernst Reuter as he said “People of the world, … look upon this city.” For months, these pilots delivered food by airlift and saved Berlin from starvation. Many of these soldiers risked their lives doing this. Dozens lost their lives. We will remember and honor them forever. I thank the 16 million Americans who have been stationed in Germany over the past decades. Without their support as soldiers, diplomats and generally as facilitators it never would have been possible to overcome the division of Europe. We are happy to have American soldiers in Germany, today and in the future. They are ambassadors of their country in our country, just as many Americans with German roots today act as ambassadors of my country here. I think of John F. Kennedy, who won the hearts of despairing Berliners during his 1963 visit after the construction of the Berlin Wall when he called out to them: “Ich bin ein Berliner.” Ronald Reagan far earlier than others saw and recognized the sign of the times when, standing before the Brandenburg Gate in 1987, he demanded: “Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate … Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.” This appeal is something that will never be forgotten. I thank George Herbert Walker Bush for placing his trust in Germany and then Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl and presenting us Germans with an offer of immeasurable value in May 1989: “Partnership in leadership.” What a generous offer, 40 years after the end of World War II. Just last Saturday we saw each other again in Berlin, along with Mikhail Gorbachev. We also owe him a debt of gratitude. Ladies and gentlemen, to sum it up in one sentence: I know, we Germans know, how much we owe to you, our American friends. We as a nation, and I personally, will never forget that. All over Europe the common quest for freedom released an incredible power: in the trade union Solidarno in Poland, amongst the reformers surrounding Václav Havel in Czechoslovakia, at the first opening of the Iron Curtain in Hungary and at the demonstrations that took place every Monday in the GDR. Where there was once only a dark wall, a door suddenly opened and we all walked through it: onto the streets, into the churches, across the borders. Everyone was given the chance to build something new, to make a difference, to venture a new beginning. I also started anew. I left my job as a physicist at the Academy of Sciences in East Berlin behind me and went into politics. Because I finally had the chance to make a difference. Because I had the impression that now it was possible to change things. It was possible for me to do something. Ladies and gentlemen, twenty years have passed since we were given this incredible gift of freedom. But there is still nothing that inspires me more, nothing that spurns me on more, nothing that fills me more with positive feelings than the power of freedom. A person who has experienced such a positive surprise in life believes that much is possible. Or, to put it in the words of Bill Clinton in Berlin in 1994: “Nothing will stop us. All things are possible.” Yes, all things are possible. Like the fact that a woman like me can stand before you today. That a man like Arnold Vaatz, who spent time in prison because he was a dissident during the GDR regime in Dresden, can be here today as a Member of the German Bundestag and of my delegation. All things are possible, also in the 21st century, in the age of globalization. We back home in Germany know just as well as you do in America that many people are afraid of globalization. We do not just brush these concerns aside. We recognize the difficulties. And yet it is our duty to convince people that globalization is an immense global opportunity, for each and every continent, because it forces us to act together with others. The alternative to globalization would be shutting ourselves off from others, but this is not a viable alternative. It would lead only to isolation and therefore misery. Thinking in terms of alliances and partnerships on the other hand, is what will take us into a good future. Ladies and gentlemen, it is true that America and Europe have had their share of disagreements. One may feel the other is sometimes too hesitant and fearful, or from the opposite perspective, too headstrong and pushy. And nevertheless, I am deeply convinced that there is no better partner for Europe than America and no better partner for America than Europe. Because what brings Europeans and Americans together and keeps them together is not just a shared history. What brings and keeps Europeans and Americans together are not just shared interests and the common global challenges that all regions of the world face. That alone would not be sufficient to explain the very special partnership between Europe and America and make it last. It is more than that. That which brings Europeans and Americans closer together and keeps them close is a common basis of shared values. It is a common idea of the individual and his inviolable dignity. It is a common understanding of freedom in responsibility. This is what we stand for in the unique transatlantic partnership and in the community of shared values that is NATO. This is what fills “Partnership in Leadership” with life, ladies and gentlemen. This basis of values was what ended the Cold War, and it is this basis of values that will enable us to stand the tests of our times- and these tests we must stand. Germany is united, Europe is united. That is what we have achieved. Now, today, our political generation must prove that it is able to meet the challenges of the 21st century, and that in a sense it is able to tear down today’s walls. What does that mean? First it means building peace and security, second, achieving prosperity and justice, and third, protecting our planet. Here, too, America and Europe are called upon in a very special way. Even after the end of the Cold War we are thus faced with the task of tearing down the walls between different concepts of life, in other words the walls in people’s minds that make it difficult time and again to understand one another in this world of ours. This is why the ability to show tolerance is so important. While, for us, our way of life is the best possible way, others do not necessarily feel that way. There are different ways to create peaceful coexistence. Tolerance means showing respect for other people’s history, traditions, religion and cultural identity. But let there be no misunderstanding: Tolerance does not mean “anything goes.” There must be zero tolerance towards all those who show no respect for the inalienable rights of the individual and who violate human rights. Zero tolerance must also be shown if, for example, weapons of mass destruction fall into the hands of Iran and possibly threaten our security! Iran must be aware of this. Iran knows our offer, but Iran also knows where we draw the line: A nuclear bomb in the hands of an Iranian President who denies the Holocaust, threatens Israel and denies Israel the right to exist, is not acceptable! For me, Israel’s security will never be open to negotiation. Not only Israel is threatened but the entire free world. Whoever threatens Israel also threatens us! This is why the free world meets this threat headon, if necessary with tough economic sanctions. Ladies and gentlemen, Germany will therefore provide staunch support to the peace process with the aim of realizing a twostate solution, a Jewish State of Israel and a Palestinian state. We also stand up to the threat of international terrorism. We are aware that no country, no matter how strong, can do this alone. We all need partners. We are only strong if we are part of a community of partners. Since we shared the view of the then President George W. Bush, after 9/11, that we had to do everything we could to prevent Afghanistan from ever again harboring a threat to security, Germany has since 2002 been present on the ground with the third-largest troop contingent. We want to make the concept of networked security successful. This means that civilian and military engagement are inextricably linked. The international community’s commitment in Afghanistan is undoubtedly a tough one. It places great demands on all of us, and it must be taken into the next phase as soon as the new Afghan government is in office. Our objective must be to develop a strategy to transfer responsibility, which we want to do early next year at a joint UN conference. We will be successful if, as we have done up to now, we continue travel this road together in the Alliance, every step of the way. Germany is ready to shoulder that responsibility. There is no doubt that NATO is and will continue to be the crucial corner-stone of our collective defense. Its Security Concept is being constantly developed and adapted to new challenges. Its foundation and clear compass for peace and freedom will, however, remain unchanged. It is my firm belief that we Europeans can contribute even more in the future. For we Europeans are currently working towards giving our European Union a new contractual basis. The final signature has just been added. This will make the EU stronger and more capable of action, and thus make it a strong and reliable partner for the United States. On this basis we can build stable partnerships with others, first and foremost with Russia, China and India. This is because our world is freer and more networked than ever. The fall of the Berlin Wall, the revolution in information and communication technology, the rise of China, India and other countries to become dynamic economies – all this has made the 21st century world a different place from the world we knew in the 20th century. That’s a good thing, because freedom is the very essence of our economy and society. Without freedom the human mind is prevented from unleashing its creative force. But what is also clear is that this freedom does not stand alone. It is freedom in responsibility and freedom to exercise responsibility. For that reason the world needs order. The near-collapse of the international financial markets showed what happens when there is no such order. If there is one lesson the world has learned from last year’s financial crisis, it is that there is no alternative to a global framework for a globalized economy. Without universally-binding rules for transparency and supervision there can be no greater freedom but rather we risk the abuse of freedom and thus instability. In a way this is a second wall that has to fall: A wall standing in the way of a truly global economic order, a wall of regional and exclusively national thinking. The key to cooperation between the major industrialized countries and emerging economies lies in the G20. Here again cooperation between America and Europe is a crucial corner-stone. It is a cooperation that is not exclusive but rather inclusive. The G20 has shown that it can take action. We need to resist the pressure of those who almost led the nations of this world into the abyss. That means no more and no less than that international economic policy must become more sustainable. This crisis was also an expression of too much short-term thinking. Millions of people all over the world might lose their jobs or even suffer poverty and starvation because of this. To achieve prosperity and justice we must do all we can to prevent such a crisis in the future. That also means not giving in to the temptation of protectionism. This is why the WTO Doha negotiations are so important. The success of the Doha Round would send a valuable message of the openness of the world economy, particularly in the current crisis. Equally, the Transatlantic Economic Council can also fulfill an important task. We can use it to prevent competing subsidies and give incentives to reduce trade barriers between Europe and America. I appeal to you: Let us jointly work towards a world economic order which is in the interests of both America and Europe! Ladies and gentlemen, the fact that global challenges can only be met by comprehensive international cooperation is also shown by a third great challenge of the 21st century, by a wall, so to speak, separating the present from the future. That wall prevents us from seeing the needs of future generations, it prevents us from taking the measures urgently needed to protect the very basis of our life and climate. We can already see where this wasteful attitude towards our future leads: In the Arctic icebergs are melting, in Africa people are becoming refugees due to environmental damage, and global sea levels are rising. I am pleased that you in your work together with President Obama attach such significance to protecting our climate. For we all know: We have no time to lose! We need an agreement at the climate conference in Copenhagen in December. We have to agree on one objective – global warming must not exceed two degrees Celsius. To achieve this we need the readiness of all nations to assume internationally binding obligations. We cannot afford failure with regard to achieving the climate protection objectives scientists tell us are crucial. That would not only be irresponsible from an ecological point of view, but would also be technologically short-sighted, for the development of new technologies in the energy sector offers major opportunities for growth and jobs in the future. No doubt about it – in December the world will look to us, to Europe and America. It is true that there can be no agreement without China and India accepting obligations, but I am convinced that if we in Europe and America show that we are ready to accept binding obligations, we will also be able to persuade China and India to join in. And then, in Copenhagen, we will be able to tear down the wall between the present and the future – in the interests of our children and grandchildren and of sustainable development worldwide. Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that, just as we found the strength in the 20th century to tear down a wall made of barbed wire and concrete, today we have the strength to overcome the walls of the 21st century, walls in our minds, walls of short-sighted self-interest, walls between the present and the future. Ladies and gentlemen, my confidence is inspired by a very special sound – that of the Freedom Bell in the Schöneberg Town Hall in Berlin. Since 1950 a copy of the original American Liberty Bell has hung there. A gift from American citizens, it is a symbol of the promise of freedom, a promise that has been fulfilled. On October 3, 1990 the Freedom Bell rang to mark the reunification of Germany, the greatest moment of joy for the German people. On September 13, 2001, two days after 9/11, it tolled again, to mark America’s darkest hour. The Freedom Bell in Berlin is, like the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, a symbol which reminds us that freedom does not come about of itself. It must be struggled for and then defended anew every day of our lives. In this endeavor Germany and Europe will also in future remain strong and dependable partners for America. That I promise you. Thank you very much.",178,257,0,Democrat,41,57,2,Democrat,111
Gordon Brown,The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,200,3,2009,Prime Minister,"Madam Speaker, Mr Vice-President, distinguished members of Congress, I come to this great capital of this great nation, an America renewed under a new President to say that America's faith in the future has been, is and always will be an inspiration to the whole world. The very creation of America was a bold affirmation of faith in the future: a future you have not just believed in but built with your own hands. And on January 20th, you the American people began to write the latest chapter in the American story, with a transition of dignity, in which both sides of the aisle could take great pride. President Obama gave the world renewed hope, and on that day billions of people truly looked to Washington D.C as ""a shining city upon a hill."" And I hope that you will allow me to single out for special mention today one of your most distinguished Senators, known in every continent and a great friend. Northern Ireland is today at peace, more Americans have health care, more children around the world are going to school, and for all those things we owe a great debt to the life and courage of, Senator Edward Kennedy. And so today, having talked to him last night, I want to announce that Her Majesty The Queen, has awarded an honorary Knighthood for Sir Edward Kennedy. Madam Speaker, Mr Vice-President, I come in friendship to renew, for new times, our special relationship founded upon our shared history, our shared values and, I believe, our shared futures. I grew up in the 1960s as America, led by President Kennedy, looked to the heavens and saw not the endless void of the unknown, but a new frontier to dare to discover and explore. People said it couldn't be done - but America did it. And 20 years later, in the 1980's, America led by President Reagan refused to accept the fate of millions trapped behind an Iron Curtain, and insisted instead that the people of Eastern Europe be allowed to join the ranks of nations which live safe, strong and free. People said it would never happen in our lifetime but it did, and the Berlin Wall was torn down brick by brick. So early in my life I came to understand that America is not just the indispensible nation, it is the irrepressible nation. Throughout your history Americans have led insurrections in the human imagination, have summoned revolutionary times through your belief that there is no such thing as an impossible endeavour. It is never possible to come here without having your faith in the future renewed. Throughout a whole century the American people stood liberty's ground not just in one world war but in two. And I want you to know that we will never forget the sacrifice and service of the American soldiers who gave their lives for people whose names they never knew, and whose faces they never saw, and yet people who have lived in freedom thanks to the bravery and valour of the Americans who gave the ""last full measure of devotion."" Cemetery after cemetery across Europe honours the memory of American soldiers, resting row upon row - often alongside comrades-in-arms from Britain. There is no battlefield of liberty on which there is not a piece of land that is marked out as American and there is no day of remembrance in Britain that is not also a commemoration of American courage and sacrifice far from home. In the hardest days of the last century, faith in the future kept America alive and I tell you that America kept faith in the future alive for all the world. Almost every family in Britain has a tie that binds them to America. So I want you to know that whenever a young American soldier or marine, sailor or airman is killed in conflict anywhere in the world, we, the people of Britain, grieve with you. Know that your loss is our loss; your families' sorrow is our families' sorrow and your nation's determination is our nation's determination that they shall not have died in vain. And let me pay tribute to the soldiers, yours and ours, who again fight side by side in the plains of Afghanistan and the streets of Iraq, just as their forefathers fought side by side in the sands of Tunisia, on the beaches of Normandy and then on the bridges over the Rhine. And after that terrible September morning when your homeland was attacked, the Coldstream Guards at Buckingham Palace played the Star Spangled Banner. Our own British tribute as we wept for our friends in the land of the free and the home of the brave. And let me promise you our continued support to ensure there is no hiding place for terrorists, no safe haven for terrorism. You should be proud that in the hard years since 2001 you have shown that while terrorists may destroy buildings and even, tragically, lives, they have not, and will not ever, destroy the American spirit. So let it be said of the friendship between our two countries; that it is in times of trial - true, in the face of fear - faithful and amidst the storms of change - constant. And let it be said of our friendship - formed and forged over two tumultuous centuries, a friendship tested in war and strengthened in peace - that it has not just endured but is renewed in each generation to better serve our shared values and fulfil the hopes and dreams of the day. Not an alliance of convenience, but a partnership of purpose. Alliances can wither or be destroyed, but partnerships of purpose are indestructible. Friendships can be shaken, but our friendship is unshakeable. Treaties can be broken but our partnership is unbreakable. And I know there is no power on earth than can drive us apart. We will work tirelessly with you as partners for peace in the Middle East: for a two state solution that provides for nothing less than a secure Israel safe within its borders existing side by side with a viable Palestinian state. And our shared message to Iran is simple - we are ready for you to rejoin the world community. But first, you must cease your threats and suspend your nuclear programme. And we will work tirelessly with all those in the international community who are ready to reduce the threat of nuclear proliferation. Past British Prime Ministers have travelled to this Capitol building in times of war to talk of war. I come now to talk of new and different battles we must fight together; to speak of a global economy in crisis and a planet imperilled. These are new priorities for our new times. And let us be honest - tonight too many parents, after they put their children to bed, will speak of their worries about losing their jobs or the need to sell the house. Too many will share stories of friends or neighbours already packing up their homes, and too many will talk of a local store or business that has already gone to the wall. For me, this global recession is not to be measured just in statistics, or in graphs or in figures on a balance sheet. Instead I see one individual with their own aspirations and increasingly their own apprehensions, and then another, and then another. Each with their own stars to reach for. Each part of a family, each at the heart of a community now in need of help and hope. And when banks have failed and markets have faltered, we the representatives of the people have to be the people's last line of defence. And that's why there is no financial orthodoxy so entrenched, no conventional thinking so engrained, no special interest so strong that it should ever stand in the way of the change that hard-working families need. We have learned through this world downturn that markets should be free but never values-free, that the risks people take should never be separated from the responsibilities they meet. And if perhaps some once thought it beyond our power to shape global markets to meet the needs of people, we know now that is our duty; we cannot and must not stand aside. In our families and workplaces and places of worship, we celebrate men and women of integrity who work hard, treat people fairly, take responsibility and look out for others. If these are the principles we live by in our families and neighbourhoods, they should also be the principles that guide and govern our economic life too. In these days the world has learned that what makes for the good economy makes for the good society. My father was a Minister of the church and I have learned again what I was taught by him: that wealth must help more than the wealthy, good fortune must serve more than the fortunate and riches must enrich not just some of us but all. And these enduring values are the values we need for these new times. We tend to think of the sweep of destiny as stretching across many months and years before culminating in decisive moments we call history. But sometimes the reality is that defining moments of history come suddenly and without warning. And the task of leadership then is to define them, shape them and move forward into the new world they demand. An economic hurricane has swept the world, creating a crisis of credit and of confidence. History has brought us now to a point where change is essential. We are summoned not just to manage our times but to transform them. Our task is to rebuild prosperity and security in a wholly different economic world, where competition is no longer local but global and banks are no longer just national but international. And we need to understand what went wrong in this crisis, that the very financial instruments that were designed to diversify risk across the banking system instead spread contagion across the globe. And today's financial institutions are so interwoven that a bad bank anywhere is a threat to good banks everywhere. So should we succumb to a race to the bottom and a protectionism that history tells us that, in the end, protects no-one? No. We should have the confidence that we can seize the opportunities ahead and make the future work for us. Why? Because while today people are anxious and feel insecure, over the next two decades literally billions of people in other continents will move from being simply producers of their goods to being consumers of our goods and in this way our world economy will double in size. Twice as many opportunities for business, twice as much prosperity, and the biggest expansion of middle class incomes and jobs the world has ever seen. And America and Britain will succeed and lead if we tap into the talents of our people, unleash the genius of our scientists and set free the drive of our entrepreneurs. We will win the race to the top if we can develop the new high value products and services and the new green technologies that the rising numbers of hard-working families across our globe will want to buy. So we must educate our way out of the downturn, invest and invent our way out of the downturn and re-tool and re-skill our way out of the downturn. And this is not blind optimism or synthetic confidence to console people; it is the practical affirmation for our times of our faith in a better future. Every time we rebuild a school we demonstrate our faith in the future. Every time we send more young people to university, every time we invest more in our new digital infrastructure, every time we increase support to our scientists, we demonstrate our faith in the future. And so I say to this Congress and this country, something that runs deep in your character and is woven in your history, we conquer our fear of the future through our faith in the future. And it is this faith in the future that means we must commit to protecting the planet for generations that will come long after us. As the Greek proverb says, why does anybody plant the seeds of a tree whose shade they will never see? The answer is because they look to the future. And I believe that you, the nation that had the vision to put a man on the moon, are also the nation with the vision to protect and preserve our planet earth. And it is only by investing in environmental technology that we can end the dictatorship of oil, and it is only by tackling climate change that we create the millions of new green jobs we need. For the lesson of this crisis is that we cannot just wait for tomorrow today. We cannot just think of tomorrow today. We cannot merely plan for tomorrow today. Our task must be to build tomorrow today. And America knows from its history that its reach goes far beyond its geography. For a century you have carried upon your shoulders the greatest of responsibilities: to work with and for the rest of the world. And let me tell you that now more than ever the rest of the world wants to work with you. And if these times have shown us anything it is that the major challenges we all face are global. No matter where it starts, an economic crisis does not stop at the water's edge. It ripples across the world. Climate change does not honour passport control. Terrorism has no respect for borders. And modern communications instantly span every continent. The new frontier is that there is no frontier, the new shared truth is that global problems need global solutions. And let me say that you now have the most pro-American European leadership in living memory. A leadership that wants to cooperate more closely together, in order to cooperate more closely with you. There is no old Europe, no new Europe, there is only your friend Europe. So once again I say we should seize the moment - because never before have I seen a world so willing to come together. Never before has that been more needed. And never before have the benefits of cooperation been so far-reaching. So when people here and in other countries ask what more can we do now to bring an end to this downturn, let me say this: we can achieve more working together. And just think of what we can do if we combine not just in a partnership for security but in a new partnership for prosperity too. On jobs, you the American people through your stimulus proposals could create or save at least 3 million jobs. We in Britain are acting with similar determination. How much nearer an end to this downturn would we be if the whole of the world resolved to do the same? And you are also restructuring your banks. So are we. But how much safer would everybody's savings be if the whole world finally came together to outlaw shadow banking systems and offshore tax havens? Just think how each of our actions, if combined, could mean a whole, much greater than the sum of the parts-- all and not just some banks stabilized, on fiscal stimulus: the impact multiplied because everybody does it, rising demand in all our countries creating jobs in each of our countries, and trade once again the engine of prosperity, the wealth of nations restored. No one should forget that it was American visionaries who over half a century ago, coming out of the deepest of depressions and the worst of wars, produced the boldest of plans for global economic cooperation because they recognised prosperity was indivisible and concluded that to be sustained it had to be shared. And I believe that ours too is a time for renewal, for a plan for tackling recession and building for the future. Every continent playing their part in a global new deal, a plan for prosperity that can benefit us all. First, so that the whole of the worldwide banking system serves our prosperity rather than risks it, let us agree rules and standards for accountability, transparency, and reward that will mean an end to the excesses and will apply to every bank, everywhere, and all the time. Second, America and a few countries cannot be expected to bear the burden of the fiscal and interest rate stimulus alone. We must share it globally. So let us work together for the worldwide reduction of interest rates and a scale of stimulus round the world equal to the depth of the recession and the dimensions of the recovery we must make. Third, let us together renew our international economic cooperation, helping the emerging markets rebuild their banks. And let us work together for a low carbon recovery worldwide. And I am confident that this President, this Congress and the peoples of the world can come together in Copenhagen this December to reach a historic agreement on climate change. And let us not forget the poorest. As we strive to spread the values of peace, political liberty, and the hope for better lives across the world, perhaps the greatest gift our generation could give to the future, the gift of America and Britain to the world could be, for every child in every country of the world, the chance millions do not have today; the chance to go to school. For let us remember there is a common bond that unites us as human beings across different beliefs, cultures and nationalities. It is at the core of my convictions, the essence of America's spirit and the heart of all faiths. And it must be at the centre of our response to the crisis of today. At their best, our values tell us that we cannot be wholly content while others go without, cannot be fully comfortable while millions go without comfort, cannot be truly happy while others grieve alone. And this too is true. All of us know that in a recession the wealthiest, the most powerful and the most privileged can find a way through for themselves. So we do not value the wealthy less when we say that our first duty is to help the not so wealthy. We do not value the powerful less when we say that our first responsibility is to help the powerless. And we do not value those who are secure less when we say that our first priority must be to help the insecure. These recent events have forced us all to think anew. And while I have learnt many things, I keep returning to something I first learned in my father's church as a child. In this most modern of crises I am drawn to the most ancient of truths; wherever there is hardship, wherever there is suffering, we cannot, we will not, pass by on the other side. But working together there is no challenge to which we are not equal, no obstacle that we cannot overcome, no aspiration so high that it cannot be achieved. In the depths of the Depression, when Franklin Roosevelt did battle with fear itself, it was not simply by the power of his words, his personality and his example that he triumphed. Yes, all these things mattered. But what mattered more was this enduring truth: that you, the American people, at your core, were, as you remain, every bit as optimistic as your Roosevelts, your Reagans and your Obamas. This is the faith in the future that has always been the story and promise of America. So at this defining moment in history let us renew our special relationship for our generation and our times. Let us restore prosperity and protect this planet and, with faith in the future, let us together build tomorrow today.",178,257,0,Democrat,41,57,2,Democrat,111
Bertie Ahern,Republic of Ireland,205,4,2008,Prime Minister,"MADAM SPEAKER, SENATOR BYRD. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, SENATOR KENNEDY AND CHAIRMAIN, AND PAST CHAIRMAIN OF IRELAND, MR. WELCH, AND DISTINGUISHED GUEST, THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND INTRODUCTION, YOUR INVITATION OF THE JOINT MEETING TO CONGRESS. IT SHOWS THE ESTEEM BETWEEN OUR TWO PEOPLES AND BETWEEN OUR TWO REPUBLICS. THOSE BONDS HAVE BEEN BUILT AND NURTURED AND REFRESHED OVER THE CENTURIES. AMERICA AND IRELAND IS SOMETHING THAT GOES BEYOND THE FRIENDSHIP BEYOND COUNTRIES. TO BE AN IRISHMAN AMONG AMERICANS IS TO BE AT HOME. SO, MADAM SPEAKER, I STAND HERE BEFORE YOU AS A PROUD SON OF IRELAND AND I STAND WITH YOU AS THE STEADFAST FRIEND OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I KNOW, MADAM SPEAKER, LIKE SO MANY OTHERS ASERVED HERE, YOU SHARE MANY LINKS WITH IRELAND. A FAMOUS SON OF WICKLOW, THE SON OF AN AMERICAN MOTHER, STOOD IN DISPLACED 128 YEARS AGO, THE FIRST IRISH LEADER TO DO SO. PURNELL TURNED TO THE UNITED STATES, AS MANY IRISH LEADERS SINCE, TO VINDICATE THE PRINCIPLES THAT'S ASPIRED YOUR FOUNDING FATHERS, THE PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY, EQUALITY AND OF JUSTICE. IN THE EARLY PART OF THE LAST CENTURY, ONE CAME HERE SEEKING HELP AS IRELAND STRUGGLED FOR INDEPENDENCE. IN MORE RECENT TIMES, MANY IRISH LEADERS CAME HERE IN THE QUEST FOR PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND. WHENEVER WE ASK FOR HELP, AMERICA'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR US, OUR FRIEND IN GOOD TIMES AND IN BAD. FROM THE VERY OUTSET, IRELAND GAVE TO AMERICA PRESIDENTS, PATRIOTS AND PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS OF A NEW NATION. BEGINNING WITH THE IRISH SCOTTS IN THE 17TH AND 18TH CENTURY THAT CAME FROM ALL CORNERS OF OUR ISLAND AND ALL CREEDS. THE IRISH HELPED TO BUILD AMERICA THE VERY BRICKS AND STONES IN THIS UNIQUE BUILDING FROM CARRIED BY THE HANDS OF IRISH IMMIGRANT LABORS. A SCULPTURE OF SCOTT-IRISH DESCENT, CREATED THE FIGURE OF FREEDOM, THE STATUE LATER RAISED TO THIS FAMOUS DOME HERE ON CAPITOL HILL. A REMINDER OF THE SHARED VALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM, WHICH INSPIRED BOTH OUR JOURNEY TOWARD INDEPENDENCE. IT SHINES AS A BEACON OF LIGHT UPON THE HILL OF ALL NATIONS OF THE EARTH. THAT STATUE ALSO TELLS OUR IRISH IMMIGRANT STORY, A STORY WHICH IS PART OF AMERICA'S OWN STORY OF IMMIGRATION, OF STRUGGLE AND OF SUCCESS. AND THE GREAT WAVES OF IRISH IMMIGRATION IN THE 19TH CENTURY CARRIED MILLIONS TO YOUR SHORES IN FLIGHT FROM FAMINE AND DISPAIR. THEY CARRIED LITTLE WITH THEM AS THEY ARRIVED ON THESE SHORES, EXCEPT A DETERMINATION TO WORK HARD AND TO SUCCEED. IN THE WORDS OF ONE, THAT ELOQUENT VOICE OF AMERICA AND IRELAND, THEY HAD THE HARDSHIPS IN THEM, PATIENCE, FORTITUDE, LONG SUFFERING AND THE COLOR OF THE NEW WORLD AND ALL OF THE OLD SONGS AND NOTHING TO LOSE. TO THOSE THAT CAME BEFORE AND AFTER, AMERICA WAS MORE THAN A DESTINATION. IT WAS A DESTINY. WE SEE THE SAME SPIRITS IN THE NEW IRISH AT HOME TODAY. THE MANY PEOPLE FROM BEYOND OUR SHORES WHO ARE NOW MAKING NEW LIVES IN IRELAND. THEY, TOO, HAVE THE COURAGE TO COME TO A FOREIGN PLACE TO FIND A WAY AND TO PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES FORE THEIR CHILDREN AND IN MANY CASES FOR THEIR FAMILIES FAR AWAY. THE NEW IRELAND A PLACE THAT SO MANY LEFT IS NOW A PLACE THAT SO MANY COME. THESE NEWCOMERS TO OUR SOCIETY HAVE ENRICHED A TEXTURE OF OUR LAND AND OF OUR LIVES. WE ARE WORKING, AS YOU ARE, TO WELCOME THOSE WHO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR SOCIETY AS THEY LIFT UP THEIR OWN LIVES WHILE WE ALSO ADDRESS THE INVETIABLE IMPLICATIONS FOR A SOCIETY, OUR CULTURE, OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR WAY OF LIFE. SO WE'RE PROFOUNDLY AWARE OF THOSE CHALLENGES AS WE ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THE CASE OF OUR UNDOCUMENTED IRISH IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY. WE HOPE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THEIR PLIGHT, TO ENABLE THEM TO REGULARIZE THEIR STATUS AND TO OPEN THEM TO A PATH OF OPEN RESIDENCY. THERE IS, OF COURSE, A WIDER ISSUE FOR CONGRESS TO ADDRESS, AND IT'S YOUR DEFINITIVE RIGHT TO ADDRESS IT. I WELCOME THE WISE WORDS OF YOUR PRESIDENT WHEN HE ADDRESSED YOU IN THE STATE OF THE UNION EARLIER THIS YEAR AND SAID HE HOPED TO FIND A SENSIBLE AND HUMANE WAY TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE HERE ILLEGALLY, TO RESOLVE A COMPLICATED ISSUE THAT UPHOLDS AMERICAN LAWS AND OUR HIGHEST IDEALS. ON THIS ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION, THAT IS SO RESOLVE TO MAKE THE FAIR AND RATIONAL CHOICES, THE PRACTICAL AND DECENT DECISIONS SO THAT FUTURE PEOPLE WILL LOOK BACK AND SAY THEY CHOSE WELL, THEY DID WHAT WAS RIGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY. MADAM SPEAKER, FOR MILLIONS ACROSS THE GLOBE, THE GREAT SYMBOL OF THE FREEDOM AND THE WELCOME OF AMERICA IS THE STATUE OF LIBERTY IN THE NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE. THE PROMISE INSCRIBED THERE SAYS SO MUCH OF YOUR COUNTRY, GIVE ME YOUR TIRED, YOUR POOR, YEARNING TO BREATHE FREE, THE RECHT REFUGES OF YOUR SHORES, SEND THOSE, I LIFT YOUR LAMP BESIDE A GOLDEN DOOR. ONE HEARD THAT PROMISE. SHE WAS A YOUNG IRISH GIRL, AGED ONLY 15. SHE WAS THE FIRST IMMIGRANT TO PASS THROUGH THE ELLIS ISLAND IMMIGRATION STATION WHEN IT WAS OFFICIALLY OPENED IN 1892. SHE CAME HERE WITH HER BROTHERS TO MAKE A NEW LIFE IN AMERICA. HER STORY IS AMONG ONE OF MILLIONS. THE IRISH TO BE FOUND IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS, THE FIREHOUSES AND THE HOSPITALS, THE SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES, IN THE BOARD ROOMS AND IN CONSTRUCTION SITES, IN CHURCHES AND IN THE SPORTS FIELDS OF AMERICA, THEIR CONTRIBUTION IS SEEN IN MUCH OF THE GREAT LITERATURE, FILM, ART AND MUSIC. EACH OF THEM IS A GREEN STRAN WOVEN. MY FRIENDS, ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, SOME OF THE MOST TERRIBLE, EVIL EVENTS IN WORLD HISTORY OCCURRED. CLOSE TO ELLIS ISLAND, NEAR THIS VERY BUILDING, AND THE SKIES AND FIELDS OF PENNSYLVANIA, IN A DAY THAT'S ETCHED IN MEMORY OF ALL HUMANITY. THE CHAPLAIN OF THE NEW YORK FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE SON OF IRISH IMMIGRANTS RUSHED TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER TO HELP THOSE WHO WERE IN DANGER AND TO ADMINISTER TO THE JURD AND DYING. -- INYOURED AND DYING. HE WAS OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED VICTIM NUMBER ONE. OF COURSE, HE WAS NO MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY OTHER VICTIM. . IN RECOGNITION OF THE BRAVERY OF ALL WHO DIED ON THAT TERRIBLE DAY, I'M DEEPLY HONORED TO BE JOINED HERE TODAY BY SOME OF FATHER MIKE'S COMRADES FROM THE NEW YORK FIRE DEPARTMENT AND NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT. OFFICER STEPHEN MCDONALD. I WANT TO THANK OFFICER STEPHEN MCDONALD OF THE NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT AND CHIEF ROBERT SWEENEY OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR BEING WITH US. I HONOR THEM AND ALL OF THEIR FALLEN COMRADES. THOSE WHO FELL ON THAT DAY AND ALL WHO HAVE FALLEN DURING THEIR DUTY TO SERVE THE PEOPLE. IT WAS A NATIONAL DAY OF MOURNING IN IRELAND AFTER 9/11. EVERY CITY, TOWN, AND VILLAGE FELL SILENT IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE DEAD. THE NAMES OF THE CASUALTY LIST OF THE TERRORIST ATTACK INCLUDED BOIL, CROTTY, COLLINS, MURPHY, MCSWEENEY, AND O'NEAL. OUR NAMES,THE NAMES OF OUR FAMILIES AND OUR FRIENDS, AND THE NAMES OF OUR NATION. THERE ARE MANY OTHER NAMES, TOO, FROM MANY OTHER NATIONS. THOSE WHO ATTACKED THE FREE NATIONS OF THE WORLD AND HUMANITY ITSELF. AND NO WORDS OF MINE THEN OR NOW ADEQUATELY ADDRESS SUCH AN IMMENSE TRAGEDY. BUT I WOULD NOT COME TO THIS PLACE TODAY WITHOUT PAUSING TO REFLECT AND TO REMEMBER AND HONOR THOSE WHO DIED ON THAT DAY. OUR HEARTS AND PRAYERS REMAIN WITH THEIR FAMILIES. MADAM SPEAKER, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IRELAND AND THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES TO GROW FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH. IT PROCEEDS FROM ALL THAT HAS GONE BEFORE, BUT IT ALSO TRIES IN THE CHANGES AND NEW CHALLENGES WHICH WE MUST FACE TOGETHER. IN IRELAND WE FIRMLY BELIEVE OUR EXPERIENCE OF HARDSHIP AND FORCED IMMIGRATION IS AT AN END. FOR THAT ACHIEVEMENT, TOO, WE OWE SO MUCH TO AMERICA. OUR TWO COUNTRIES ARE REAPING THEIR REWARDS TOGETHER. WE ARE INVESTING IN EACH OTHER'S ECONOMIES, BRINGING TOGETHER ENTREPRENEURIAL ENERGY AND CREATING EMPLOYMENT ACROSS IRELAND AND ACROSS THE 50 STATES OF AMERICA. THIS IS A TRUE MEASURE OF OUR ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENTS TOGETHER. IT POINTS TO A FRIENDSHIP EVERY BIT AS STRONG IN THE FUTURE AS IT IS TODAY. OUR RELATIONSHIP IS ALSO PART OF A BROADER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EUROPE AND AMERICA. THE ATLANTIC OCEAN WILL ALWAYS BRING EUROPE AND AMERICA TOGETHER. I DO NOT SEE THE ATLANTIC AS SOMETHING THAT KEEPS AMERICA AND EUROPE APART. IRELAND IS EUROPE'S MOSTER WITHLY STATE WITH SO MANY TIES TO THE UNITED STATES, IS A BRIDGE BETWEEN EUROPE AND AMERICA. I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN EUROPE IN THE PAST 50 YEARS. WE PUT ASIDE HOSTILITIES THAT LED TO COUNTLESS WARS OVER THE CENTURIES AND TWO WORLD WARS IN THE LAST CENTURY ALONE. WE HAVE CREATED A EUROPEAN UNION OF 27 DEMOCRATIC STATES COMMITTED TO DEMOCRACY, TO PEACE AND FREEDOM. WE ARE COMMITTED TO AN OPEN MARKET AND TO A SINGLE CURRENCY THAT BENEFITS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF EUROPEAN CITIZENS. WE ALL RECALL TWO GREAT IRISH AMERICANS, PRESIDENT KENNEDY IN 1963 AND PRESIDENT REAGAN IN 1987 STANDING AT THE BERLIN WALL DURING THE COLD WAR AND CALLING OUT FOR FREEDOM IN GERMANY AND IN EUROPE. THAT CALL WAS HEARD AS FREEDOM'S CALL ALWAYS WILL BE. BERLIN IS NOW AT THE HEART OF THE UNITED DEMOCRATIC GERMANY. ON THE FIRST OF MAY, 2004, IN MY NATIVE CITY IN DUBLIN, 10 NEW MEMBERS FORMALLY JOINED THE EUROPEAN UNION. MANY OF THEM WERE EMERGING FROM BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN AFTER DECADES OF OPPRESSION. I REMEMBER THE INTENSITY OF THE EMOTION. FOR MANY OF THESE COUNTRIES THIS WAS A MOMENT THAT WAS UNTHINKABLE ONLY A FEW YEARS BEFORE. ALONG WITH BERLIN, THE GREAT CITIES OF PRAGUE AND BUDAPEST, WARSAW HAVE JOINED DUBLIN, LONDON, PARIS, ROME, AND VIENNA AS CAPITAL CITIES WITHIN A FREE AND DEMOCRATIC EUROPEAN UNION. THE UNION NOW STRETCHES FROM THE BEAUTIFUL WEST COAST OF IRELAND WHERE THE LOCAL SAY THE NEXT PARISH IS AMERICA TO COUNTRIES WITH A LAND FRONTIER WITH RUSSIA AND UKRAINE. I PASSIONATELY BELIEVE IN EUROPE AND I PASSIONATELY BELIEVE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AS A FORCE FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD. IT IS PROFOUNDLY ENCOURAGING THAT WE ARE SEEING THE MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION CONTINUE TO RISE TOGETHER AS A FORCE FOR DEVELOPMENT, FOR STABILITY, FOR PEACE IN THE WORLD. SOON THE IRISH PEOPLE WILL VOTE IN A NEW REFORM TREATY THAT AIMS TO MAKE THE EUROPEAN UNION WORK EVEN MORE EFFECTIVELY. BOTH INTERNALLY AND IN THE WIDER WORLD. I TRUST IN THEIR WISDOM TO SUPPORT AND BELIEVE IN EUROPE AS THEY ALWAYS HAVE. MY FRIENDS, BETWEEN AMERICA AND EUROPE, THERE IS CONTRAST BUT NOT CONTRADICTION. ENERGIZED BY A COMMON FRAMEWORK OF VALUES AND IMBUED BY DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, TOGETHER WE CAN AND WE SHALL BE A BEACON FOR ECONOMIC PROGRESS. INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY, AND THE DIGNITY OF ALL MANKIND. ACTING IN PARTNERSHIP THERE ARE FEW LIMITS TO THE GOOD WE CAN DO. WE ARE ALL CITIZENS OF THE WORLD, WE MUST THEREFORE DEVELOP A TRUE SPIRIT OF GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP. THIS CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT BE AN NATIONAL PRIDE OF PATRIOTISM BUT RATHER TO COMPLEMENT IT. WE SHOULD CARE FOR OUR PLANET AS MUCH AS WE CARE FOR OUR COUNTRY. WE SHOULD CHAMPION PEACE, JUSTICE, AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACROSS THE GLOBE AS WELL AS AT HOME. AND AS AN AFFRONT TO OUR CIVILIZATION THAT OUR CHILDREN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WHO WILL DIE OF HUNGER OR CURABLE DISEASE. THIS YEAR THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, IT ANGERS US THAT SOME CORNERS OF THE WORLD REMAIN HIDDEN FROM THE LIGHT OF THE UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES EXPRESSED SO ELOQUENTLY IN THAT DOCUMENT. ALTHOUGH A SMALL COUNTRY LIKE IRELAND HAS ALWAYS SOUGHT TO PLAY A FULL PART IN THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE, WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY ADVOCATED ACTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND HUMAN DIGNITY. IRELAND BELIEVES IN MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS. WE BELIEVE IN THE UNITED NATIONS. WE BELIEVE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. AND WE BELIEVE IN MULTILATERAL ACTION. FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY IRISH MEN AND WOMEN HAVE SERVED THE CAUSE OF PEACE UNDER THE UNITED NATIONS FLAG. THEY HAVE SERVED IN THE CONGO AND LEBANON. ON THE BORDERS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND SYRIA, BETWEEN IRAQ AND IRAN, AND CYPRUS, IN LIBERIA, EAST TIMOR, AND BOSNIA AND KOSOVO AND OF COURSE AFGHANISTAN TODAY. AND TRAGEDY SOME HAVE PAID THE ULTIMATE PRICE AND THEY HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES IN THAT NOBLE SERVICE. BUT, MADAM SPEAKER, NEVER HAS THE EXPRESSION OF THE GLOBAL VILLAGE BEEN MORE APPROPRIATE. THE GREAT CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN THE 21ST CENTURY ARE TRULY GLOBAL. FALLING FINANCIAL MARKETS, RISING FOOD AND ENERGY PRICES, CLIMATE CHANGE ARE GLOBAL PHENOMENA. ERADICATING POVERTY, STARVATION, AND DISEASE, COUNTERING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, AND CONTAINING NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION ARE NOT NATIONAL BUT INTERNATIONAL ISSUES. THEY CANNOT BE OVERCOME EXCEPT BY COUNTRIES WORKING TOGETHER. IN MANY WAYS THE MODERN WORLD IS A MUCH BETTER PLACE BUT REMAINS A DANGEROUS PLACE. THE VALUES WE SHARE ARE OUR STRENGTH AND OUR PROTECTION. 40 YEARS AGO THE THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR HELD OVER THE WORLD. NOT THE LEAST TO THE WISDOM OF AMERICA'S LORDS AT CRUCIAL MOMENTS, WE NO LONGER LIVE EVERY DAY UNDER THAT SHADOW. IRELAND WAS AT THE FOREFRONT OF EFFORTS AT THE TIME TO AGREE TO NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY. TODAY THERE ARE NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR MASS DEVASTATION. THE NEED FOR CONCERTED INTERNATIONAL ACTION TO PREVENT THE PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS TECHNOLOGY IS NO LESS URGENT NOW THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST. MADAM SPEAKER, IN IRELAND TODAY WE ARE LOOKING OUT FROM OUR SHORES MORE THAN EVER BEFORE. NO LONGER WITH THOUGHTS OF EXILE BUT TO BE PART OF THE WORLD. CONNECTED TO IT. CONTRIBUTING TO IT. LEARNING FROM IT. THE LONG AND PROUD TRADITION OF IRISH MISSIONRIES, OF TEACHERS AND NURSES AND DOCTORS WORKING AROUND THE GLOBE TO COMBAT POVERTY, HUNGER, AND DISEASE CONTINUES TODAY. FOR US FAMINE AND OPPRESSION ARE NOT TRAGEDIES THAT COULD ONLY HAPPEN ELSEWHERE. THEY HAPPENED TO US AT A SAD TIME IN OUR HISTORY. THEY HAPPENED TO US AND TO THOSE WHO FLED HERE AND HAD BUILT AMERICA -- HELPED BUILD AMERICA AND MANY WHO DID NOT SURVIVE THAT FATEFUL JOURNEY ACROSS THE OCEAN. FOR THAT MORE THAN ANY OTHER REASON WE RECOGNIZE OUR OBLIGATION TO SHARE WHAT WE HAVE WITH THE POOR OF THE WORLD. AND THAT IS WHY IRELAND IS COMMITTED TO REACH THE UNITED NATIONS TARGET BY 2012. TODAY WE ARE THE SIXTH LARGEST PER CAPITA DONOR OF DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE IN THE WORLD. AND THE STRENGTH OF OUR EFFORTS TO TACKLE POVERTY, TO CURE DISEASE, AND TO FEED THE HUNGRY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD IS A MEASURE OF OUR COMMON HUMANITY. AT THIS MOMENT IN OUR HISTORY THE COMMON HUMANITY IS BEING TESTED IN PARTS OF THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA, IN COUNTRIES LIKE SUDAN AND CHAD WHERE LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST AT A TERRIBLE SCALE. WHERE COUNTLESS FAMILIES HAVE BEEN DRIVEN FROM THEIR HOMES, WHERE CONFLICT THREATENS THE WHOLE REGION WITH CHAOS AND DESTRUCTION. TODAY IRISH SOLDIERS ARE IN CHAD AS PART OF THE UNITED NATIONS MANDATED FORCE LED BY AN IRISH OFFICER, PROTECTING HUNDREDS EVER THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES FLEEING FROM CONFLICT IN THAT COUNTRY AND IN NEIGHBORING DARFUR. AN AMERICA HAS SHOWN THE WAY IN ITS COMMITMENT TO HEAL THE CONFLICT IN SUDAN AND CAFFER AS A WHOLE. YOU HAVE SHOWN THE WAY ALSO IN YOUR ENORMOUS INVESTMENT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST H.I.V. , AIDS, AND MALARIA. YOU HAVE GIVEN HUGE SUPPORT AND LEADERSHIP TO THE PEACE PROCESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THAT TERRIBLE CONFLICT HAS BEEN A CENTER CHALLENGE TO THE WORLD AND CAUSE OF PAIN AND SUFFERING TO THE ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN PEOPLE FOR FAR TOO LONG. WE MUST SUCCEED IN OUR COLLECTIVE INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO SECURE A PEACEFUL FUTURE FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND OF PALESTINE. MADAM SPEAKER, THIS YEAR IN IRELAND WE ARE CONCENTRATING AND CELEBRATING ON THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT. IT WAS A DEFINING MOMENT IN IRELAND'S HISTORY. IN THE YEARS SINCE THEN SOME DOUBTED THAT THE AGREEMENT WOULD ENDURE. I NEVER DID. I KNEW IT WOULD LAST BECAUSE IT'S BUILT ON THE HIGHEST IDEALS OF DEMOCRACY, THE IDEALS OF LIBERTY, EQUALITY, AND JUSTICE, OF FRIENDSHIP AND RESPECT FOR OUR FELLOW MEN AND WOMEN. ABOVE ALL THE SETTLEMENT OF 1998 WILL FLOURISH BECAUSE OF ONE SIMPLE AND UNALTERABLE FACT. IT REPRESENTS THE WILL, DEMOCRATICALLY EXPRESSED NORTH AND SOUTH, OF ALL THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND TO LIVE TOGETHER IN PEACE AND HARMONY. THAT IS FAR MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY WORDS OF HATRED OR ANY WEAPON OF TERROR. IN 1981 IN MUCH DARKER DAYS FOR MY COUNTRY, THE FRIENDS OF IRELAND TO THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS WERE FOUNDED. THEIR SIMPLE PURPOSE WAS TO SEEK A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND. THE STATEMENT PLACED IN THE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD DURING A SESSION CHAIRED BY SPEAKER TIP O'NEILL REED, WE LOOK FORWARD TO A FUTURE ST. PATRICK'S DAY, ONE DAY WE CAN FORESEE, WHEN TRUE PEACE CAN FINALLY COME AND IRISH MEN AND IRISH WOMEN EVERYWHERE FROM DUBLIN TO DERRY, FROM BOSTON TO NEW YORK, TO CHICAGO AND SAN FRANCISCO SHALL HEY THE PEACE AND WELCOME THE DAWN OF A NEW IRELAND. ST. PATRICK'S DAY, 2008 A. FEW SHORT WEEKS AGO, I CAME HERE TO WASHINGTON. I CAME WITH A SIMPLE AND EXTRAORDINARY MESSAGE. THAT GREAT DAY OF HAS DAWNED, OUR PRAYER HAS BEEN ANSWERED, OUR FAITH HAS BEEN REWARDED. AFTER SO MANY DECADES OF CONFLICT I AM SO PROUD, MADAM SPEAKER, TO BE THE FIRST IRISH LEADER TO INFORM THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS IRELAND IS AT PEACE. MADAM SPEAKER, OUR DREAM AND THE DREAM OF ALL THE FRIENDS OF IRELAND IN AMERICA AND ACROSS THE WORLD HAS COME TRUE. TO YOU, TO YOUR PREDECESSORS, AND TO ALL OF THE AMERICAN LEADERS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE WHO HAVE TRAVELED WITH US, WE OFFER OUR HEARTFELT GRATITUDE. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE STEADFAST SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT BUSH, PRESIDENT CLINTON, THEIR ADMINISTRATIONS, THEIR ENVOYS, AND PREDECESSORS, AND OF COURSE FOR US THE GREAT SENATOR GEORGE MITCHELL. BEYOND WASHINGTON, THERE'S SO MANY OTHERS, WHETHER AMONGST THE DEDICATED LEADERS OF IRISH AMERICA OR IN THE SMALLEST TOWNS AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THIS GREAT NATION WHO SUPPORTED US, WHO NEVER GAVE UP HOPE THAT A SOLUTION WOULD BE FOUND AND THAT PEACE WOULD COME. WE'VE ALL SHARED THAT JOURNEY TOGETHER. WHEN WE NEEDED TO -- TRUE CHAMPIONS OF PEACE, WHEN WE NEEDED TRUE FRIENDS OR INSPIRATION, WE FOUND THEM HERE, WE FOUND THEM AMONG YOU. MANY OF THEM FOUND THEM IN THE WORDS OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, WHOSE LIFE WE RECALLED THIS YEAR ON THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH. WE BELIEVED TO BORROW DR. KING'S IMMORTAL PHRASE, THAT WE COULD GROW INTO A BEAUTIFUL SYMPHONY OF BROTHERHOOD. THIS INSPIRED US TO JUSTICE AND TO NONVIOLENCE. WE DISCOVERED THAT PEACE CAN BE FOUND WHILST SUSPENDING YOUR MORAL JUDGMENTS, WITHOUT SACRIFICING YOUR IDENTITY AND WITHOUT SURRENDERING YOUR MOST DEEPLY HELD POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS. TODAY, AS I STAND BEFORE YOU IN THIS GREAT DEMOCRATIC ASSEMBLY, I STRUGGLE TO CONVEY THE ENORMOUS GOOD THAT WAS DONE BY SO MANY PEOPLE IN MY COUNTRY WITH YOUR HELP. DO NOT UNDERSTATEMENT THE GOOD THAT YOU HAVE DONE. DO NOT -- UNDERESTIMATE THE GOOD THAT YOU HAVE DONE. DO NOT FORGET THE LEGACY YOU HAVE FORGED. IF YOU HESITATE ABOUT YOUR POWER TO INFLUENCE EVENTS FOR THE BETTER, LOOK TO IRELAND, LOOK TO THE GOOD YOU'VE DONE, LOOK AT THE RICHNESS OF SO MANY INDIVIDUAL FUTURES THAT NOW STRETCH OUT BEFORE US FOR GENERATIONS, NO LONGER SUBJECT TO CONFLICT AND TO VIOLENCE. LOOK TO THE HOPE AND CONFIDENCE THAT WE NOW FEEL ON OUR ISLAND, THE HEALING OF HISTORY AND LOOK AND BE GLAD. MADAM SPEAKER, THERE'S, OF COURSE, NO ENDING TO HISTORY. WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE NEW PROBLEMS, NEW CHALLENGES AND NEW OPPORTUNITIES. WE'RE SEEING AN EVER INCREASING RANGE OF NEW TECHNOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENTS, WHICH ARE CREATED IN GREATER SPEEDS. OUR SOCIETIES ARE INCREASINGLY DIVERSE. WE STILL SEE SOCIAL EXCLUSION AND POVERTY. WE ENDEAVOR TO HELP FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES RAVISHED BY MINORITY WHO ENGAGE IN CRIME ORDEAL IN DRUGS. WE STRIVE TO DELIVER QUALITY, -- STRIVE TO DELIVER QUALITY, AFFORDABLE -- STRIVE TO DELIVER QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, PROTECTION AND SOCIAL SECURITY FOR OUR OLDER PEOPLE. AND THESE ARE THE CHALLENGES FOR MODERN IRELAND, JUST AS THEY ARE TO AMERICA AND ACROSSED THE DEVELOPED WORLD. THESE ARE THE VERY ESSENCE OF POLITICS. AND THAT IS WHY WITH ALL OUR FAULTS AS HUMAN BEINGS, WE SEEK THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE. WE BELIEVE THAT DIVERSITY DOES NOT HAVE TO MEAN FRAGMENTATION OR DISGUARD. WE BELIEVE THAT WEALTH AND PROSPERITY DOES NOT HAVE TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY POVERTY OR INEQUALITY. WE BELIEVE THAT EVIL AND INJUSTICE NEED NOT AND WILL NOT TRIUMPH. WE BELIEVE AND WE INSIST THAT ALL THAT IS GOOD AND JUST IS ALSO POSSIBLE. WE BELIEVE IN OUR REPUBLICS AND OUR FORMS OF GOVERNMENT IN WHICH THE SOVEREIGN POWER RESIDES IN THE WHOLE BODY OF THE PEOPLE AND IS EXERCISED BY REPRESENTATIVES ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE. AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT ONCE SAID, THE SUPREME PURPOSE OF HISTORY IS A BETTER WORLD. AND MAKING A BETTER WORLD IS ALSO THE SUPREME PURPOSE OF REPRESENTED OF POLITICS AND THEIR TWO DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICS. MADAM SPEAKER, I WILL SHORTLY STEP DOWN FROM THE OFFICE OF TAOISEACH AFTER ALMOST 11 YEARS. I'M HONORED TO HAVE BEEN ELECTED BY THE IRISH PEOPLE TO SERVE THEM IN THAT GREAT OFFICE. TOMORROW AS I JOURNEY HOME TO IRELAND FOR THE LAST TIME AS TAOISEACH, I WILL TRAVEL TO THE GREAT CITY OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. THERE I WILL JOIN MY GREAT FRIEND, SENATOR EDWARD KENNEDY AND TO PAY TRIBUTE TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND SENATOR ROBERT KENNEDY, GREAT IRISHMEN AND GREAT LEADERS. IN DOING SO, I WILL PAY TRIBUTE. IN DOING SO, I WILL PAY FITTING TRIBUTE TO ALL THE IRISH IN AMERICA. ON THE SIXTH OF MAY, MADAM SPEAKER, I WILL GO TO THAT FAMOUS FIELD ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER IN IRELAND WHERE OVER THREE CENTURIES AGO, A BATTLE WAS WAGED BETWEEN THE KING WILLIAMS AND KING JAMES. IT WAS NOT JUST AN IRISH BATTLE. IT WAS PART OF A WIDER EUROPEAN STRUGGLE OF POWER, OF POLITICS AND OF RELIGION. FOR CENTURIES AFTER, THE TWO SIDES ON THAT FIELD REMAINED APART AND REMAINED DIVIDED. TODAY, BOTH SIDES, PROUD OF THEIR HISTORY AND CONFIDENT OF THEIR IDENTITY, CAN COME TOGETHER IN PEACE AND HARMONY. THEY CAN OFFER EACH OTHER THE OPEN HAND OF FRIENDSHIP. THEY WILL REAFFIRM AGAIN WHAT IRELAND HAS ACHIEVED AND WHAT WE KNOW IN OUR HEARTS TO BE TRUE. CENTURIES OF WAR, OF STRIFE AND OF STRUGGLE ARE OVER. AND OVER FOR GOOD. THE FIELD OF SLAUGHTER IS NOW A MEETING PLACE OF MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING. OUR CHILDREN WILL LIVE IN PEACE AND THEIR CHILDREN WILL ENJOY THE FRUITS OF THEIR INHERITANCE. THIS IS THE TRIUMPH OF PEOPLE AND OF POLITICS. THIS IS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF DEMOCRACY, THE GREAT ACHIEVEMENT OF IRELAND AND THE GREAT BLESSING OF PEACE. ON THE SAME DAY, I’LL GO TO THE PRESIDENT OF IRELAND, A WOMAN WHO ROSE FROM THE CONFLICT STREETS OF BELFAST TO BE ELECTED OUR HEAD OF STATE AND OUR FIRST CITIZEN. I WILL OFFER HER MY RESIGNATION OF TAOISEACH. I WILL HAND OVER THE SEAL OF OFFICE WHICH I SO PROUDLY HELD. FINALLY IN THE MORNING AFTER, IN THE HOURS BEFORE MY WORTHY SUCCESSOR STEPS FORWARD TO STAND IN MY PLACE, I WILL STAND SILENTLY TO SIMPLE GRAVES OF THE PATRIOT DEAD WHO PROCLAIMED IRELAND'S REPUBLIC AND WHO FOUGHT FOR IRELAND'S FREEDOM IN 1916. AND THERE I WILL DISCHARGE MY LAST DUTY OF TAOISEACH AND PAY THE HOMAGE THAT IRELAND OWES TO THOSE MEN AND THOSE WOMEN AND I WILL RECALL THE WORDS OF THE 1916 PROCLAMATION, SO RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES' DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND SO RELEVANT TO HUMANITY AROUND THE WORLD. THE REPUBLIC GUARANTEES RELIGIOUS AND CIVIL LIBERTY, EQUAL RIGHTS AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO ALL ITS CITIZENS AND DECLARES ITS RESOLVE TO PURSUE THE HAPPINESS AND PROSPERITY OF THE WHOLE NATION AND OF ALL ITS PARTS, CHERISHING ALL THE CHILDREN OF THE NATION EQUALLY. THESE ARE THE VALUES ON WHICH IRELAND STANDS, AND THESE ARE THE VALUES BY WHICH I STRIVE TO LIVE. THE VINDICATION OF THESE UNIVERSAL VALUES IS THE HIGHEST TRIBUTE WE CAN PAY TO THOSE WHO HAVE GONE BEFORE AND THE LEGACY THAT WE CAN BEQUEATH FOR THOSE WHO ARE YET TO COME. THOSE ARE NO FINER WORDS IN WHICH TO FINISH ON WHICH TO SAY, IN HISTORY, IN POLITICS AND IN LIFE THERE ARE NO ENDS, ONLY NEW BEGINNINGS. SO LET US BEGIN. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.",202,233,0,Democrat,49,49,2,Democrat,110
Nicolas Sarkozy,French Republic,220,11,2007,President ,"Madam Speaker, Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of the United States Congress, Ladies and Gentlemen, The state of our friendship and our alliance is strong. Friendship, first and foremost, means being true to one's friends. Since the United States first appeared on the world scene, the loyalty between the French and American people has never failed. And far from being weakened by the vicissitudes of History, it has never ceased growing stronger. Friends may have differences; they may have disagreements; they may have disputes. But in times of difficulty, in times of hardship, friends stand together, side by side; they support each other; and help one another. In times of difficulty, in times of hardship, America and France have always stood side by side, supported one another, helped one another, fought for each other's freedom. The United States and France remain true to the memory of their common history, true to the blood spilled by their children in common battles. But they are not true merely to the memory of what they accomplished together in the past. They remain true, first and foremost, to the same ideal, the same principles, the same values that have always united them. The deliberations of your Congress are conducted under the double gaze of Washington and Lafayette. Lafayette, whose 250th birthday we are celebrating this year and who was the first foreign dignitary, in 1824, to address a joint session of Congress. What was it that brought these two men--so far apart in age and background--together, if not their faith in common values, the heritage of the Enlightenment, the same love for freedom and justice? Upon first meeting Washington, Lafayette told him: ""I have come here to learn, not to teach."" It was this new spirit and youth of the Old World seeking out the wisdom of the New World that opened a new era for all of humanity. From the very beginning, the American dream meant putting into practice the dreams of the Old World. From the very beginning, the American dream meant proving to all mankind that freedom, justice, human rights and democracy were no utopia but were rather the most realistic policy there is and the most likely to improve the fate of each and every person. America did not tell the millions of men and women who came from every country in the world and who--with their hands, their intelligence and their heart--built the greatest nation in the world: ""Come, and everything will be given to you."" She said: ""Come, and the only limits to what you'll be able to achieve will be your own courage and your own talent."" America embodies this extraordinary ability to grant each and every person a second chance. Here, both the humblest and most illustrious citizens alike know that nothing is owed to them and that everything has to be earned. That's what constitutes the moral value of America. America did not teach men the idea of freedom; she taught them how to practice it. And she fought for this freedom whenever she felt it to be threatened somewhere in the world. It was by watching America grow that men and women understood that freedom was possible. What made America great was her ability to transform her own dream into hope for all mankind. Ladies and Gentlemen, The men and women of my generation heard their grandparents talk about how in 1917, America saved France at a time when it had reached the final limits of its strength, which it had exhausted in the most absurd and bloodiest of wars. The men and women of my generation heard their parents talk about how in 1944, America returned to free Europe from the horrifying tyranny that threatened to enslave it. Fathers took their sons to see the vast cemeteries where, under thousands of white crosses so far from home, thousands of young American soldiers lay who had fallen not to defend their own freedom but the freedom of all others, not to defend their own families, their own homeland, but to defend humanity as a whole. Fathers took their sons to the beaches where the young men of America had so heroically landed. They read them the admirable letters of farewell that those 20-year-old soldiers had written to their families before the battle to tell them: ""We don't consider ourselves heroes. We want this war to be over. But however much dread we may feel, you can count on us."" Before they landed, Eisenhower told them: ""The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you."" And as they listened to their fathers, watched movies, read history books and the letters of soldiers who died on the beaches of Normandy and Provence, as they visited the cemeteries where the star-spangled banner flies, the children of my generation understood that these young Americans, 20 years old, were true heroes to whom they owed the fact that they were free people and not slaves. France will never forget the sacrifice of your children. To those 20-year-old heroes who gave us everything, to the families of those who never returned, to the children who mourned fathers they barely got a chance to know, I want to express France's eternal gratitude. On behalf of my generation, which did not experience war but knows how much it owes to their courage and their sacrifice; on behalf of our children, who must never forget; to all the veterans who are here today and, notably the seven I had the honor to decorate yesterday evening, one of whom, Senator Inouye, belongs to your Congress, I want to express the deep, sincere gratitude of the French people. I want to tell you that whenever an American soldier falls somewhere in the world, I think of what the American army did for France. I think of them and I am sad, as one is sad to lose a member of one's family. Ladies and Gentlemen, The men and women of my generation remember the Marshall Plan that allowed their fathers to rebuild a devastated Europe. They remember the Cold War, during which America again stood as the bulwark of the Free World against the threat of new tyranny. I remember the Berlin crisis and Kennedy who unhesitatingly risked engaging the United States in the most destructive of wars so that Europe could preserve the freedom for which the American people had already sacrificed so much. No one has the right to forget. Forgetting, for a person of my generation, would be tantamount to self-denial. But my generation did not love America only because she had defended freedom. We also loved her because for us, she embodied what was most audacious about the human adventure; for us, she embodied the spirit of conquest. We loved America because for us, America was a new frontier that was continuously pushed back--a constantly renewed challenge to the inventiveness of the human spirit. My generation shared all the American dreams. Our imaginations were fueled by the winning of the West and Hollywood. By Elvis Presley, Duke Ellington, Hemingway. By John Wayne, Charlton Heston, Marilyn Monroe, Rita Hayworth. And by Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins, fulfilling mankind's oldest dream. What was so extraordinary for us was that through her literature, her cinema and her music, America always seemed to emerge from adversity even greater and stronger; that instead of causing America to doubt herself, such ordeals only strengthened her belief in her values. What makes America strong is the strength of this ideal that is shared by all Americans and by all those who love her because they love freedom. America's strength is not only a material strength, it is first and foremost a spiritual and moral strength. No one expressed this better than a black pastor who asked just one thing of America: that she be true to the ideal in whose name he--the grandson of a slave--felt so deeply American. His name was Martin Luther King. He made America a universal role model. The world still remembers his words--words of love, dignity and justice. America heard those words and America changed. And the men and women who had doubted America because they no longer recognized her began loving her again. Fundamentally, what are those who love America asking of her, if not to remain forever true to her founding values? Ladies and Gentlemen, Today as in the past, as we stand at the beginning of the 21st century, it is together that we must fight to defend and promote the values and ideals of freedom and democracy that men such as Washington and Lafayette invented together. Together we must fight against terrorism. On September 11, 2001, all of France--petrified with horror--rallied to the side of the American people. The front-page headline of one of our major dailies read: ""We are all American."" And on that day, when you were mourning for so many dead, never had America appeared to us as so great, so dignified, so strong. The terrorists had thought they would weaken you. They made you greater. The entire world felt admiration for the courage of the American people. And from day one, France decided to participate shoulder to shoulder with you in the war in Afghanistan. Let me tell you solemnly today: France will remain engaged in Afghanistan as long as it takes, because what's at stake in that country is the future of our values and that of the Atlantic Alliance. For me, failure is not an option. Terrorism will not win because democracies are not weak, because we are not afraid of this barbarism. America can count on France. Together we must fight against proliferation. Success in Libya and progress under way in North Korea shows that nuclear proliferation is not inevitable. Let me say it here before all of you: The prospect of an Iran armed with nuclear weapons is unacceptable. The Iranian people is a great people. It deserves better than the increased sanctions and growing isolation to which its leaders condemn it. Iran must be convinced to choose cooperation, dialogue and openness. No one must doubt our determination. Together we must help the people of the Middle East find the path of peace and security. To the Israeli and Palestinian leaders I say this: Don't hesitate! Risk peace! And do it now! The status quo hides even greater dangers: that of delivering Palestinian society as a whole to the extremists that contest Israel's existence; that of playing into the hands of radical regimes that are exploiting the deadlock in the conflict to destabilize the region; that of fueling the propaganda of terrorists who want to set Islam against the West. France wants security for Israel and a State for the Palestinians. Together we must help the Lebanese people affirm their independence, their sovereignty, their freedom, their democracy. What Lebanon needs today is a broad-based president elected according to the established schedule and in strict respect of the Constitution. France stands engaged alongside all the Lebanese. I will not accept attempts to subjugate the Lebanese people. Ladies and Gentlemen, America feels it has the vocation to inspire the world. Because she is the most powerful country in the world. Because, for more than two centuries, she has striven to uphold the ideals of democracy and freedom. But this stated responsibility comes with duties, the first of which is setting an example. Those who love this nation which, more than any other, has demonstrated the virtues of free enterprise expect America to be the first to denounce the abuses and excesses of a financial capitalism that sets too great a store on speculation. They expect her to commit fully to the establishment of the necessary rules and safeguards. The America I love is the one that encourages entrepreneurs, not speculators. Those who admire the nation that has built the world's greatest economy and has never ceased trying to persuade the world of the advantages of free trade expect her to be the first to promote fair exchange rates. The yuan is already everyone's problem. The dollar cannot remain solely the problem of others. If we're not careful, monetary disarray could morph into economic war. We would all be its victims. Those who love the country of wide open spaces, national parks and nature reserves expect America to stand alongside Europe in leading the fight against global warming that threatens the destruction of our planet. I know that each day, in their cities and states, the American people are more aware of the stakes and determined to act. This essential fight for the future of humanity must be all of America's fight. Those who have not forgotten that it was the United States that, at the end of the Second World War, raised hopes for a new world order are asking America to take the lead in the necessary reforms of the UN, the IMF, the World Bank and the G8. Our globalized world must be organized for the 21st century, not for the last century. The emerging countries we need for global equilibrium must be given their rightful place. Ladies and Gentlemen, Allow me to express one last conviction: Trust Europe. In this unstable, dangerous world, the United States of America needs a strong, determined Europe. With the simplified treaty I proposed to our partners, the European Union is about to emerge from 10 years of discussions on its institutions and 10 years of paralysis. Soon it will have a stable president and a more powerful High Representative for foreign and security policy, and it must now reactivate the construction of its military capacities. The ambition I am proposing to our partners is based on a simple observation: There are more crises than there are capacities to face them. NATO cannot be everywhere. The EU must be able to act, as it did in the Balkans and in the Congo, and as it will tomorrow on the border of Sudan and Chad. For that the Europeans must step up their efforts. My approach is purely pragmatic. Having learned from history, I want the Europeans, in the years to come, to have the means to shoulder a growing share of their defense. Who could blame the United States for ensuring its own security? No one. Who could blame me for wanting Europe to ensure more of its own security? No one. All of our Allies, beginning with the United States, with whom we most often share the same interests and the same adversaries, have a strategic interest in a Europe that can assert itself as a strong, credible security partner. At the same time, I want to affirm my attachment to NATO. I say it here before this Congress: The more successful we are in the establishment of a European Defense, the more France will be resolved to resume its full role in NATO. I would like France, a founding member of our Alliance and already one of its largest contributors, to assume its full role in the effort to renew NATO's instruments and means of action and, in this context, to allow its relations with the Alliance to evolve. This is no time for theological quarrels but for pragmatic responses to make our security tools more effective and operational in the face of crises. The EU and NATO must march hand in hand. Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to be your friend, your ally and your partner. But a friend who stands on his own two feet. An independent ally. A free partner. France must be stronger. I am determined to carry through with the reforms that my country has put off for all too long. I will not turn back, because France has turned back for all too long. My country has enormous assets. While respecting its unique identity, I want to put it into a position to win all the battles of globalization. I passionately love France. I am lucid about the work that remains to be accomplished. It is this ambitious France that I have come to present to you today. A France that comes out to meet America to renew the pact of friendship and the alliance that Washington and Lafayette sealed in Yorktown. Together let us be worthy of their example, let us be equal to their ambition, let us be true to their memories! Long live the United States of America. Long Live France! Long live French-American friendship!",202,233,0,Democrat,49,49,2,Democrat,110
King Abdullah ll Bin Al Hussein,Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,663,3,2007,King ,"In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful, Madam Speaker, Mr Vice President, Honorable Senators and Members of Congress, My friends, Thank you for such a warm welcome. It is an honor to stand, as my father did, before this historic institution. Allow me to thank you, on behalf of all Jordanians. Jordan and the United States have had a long friendship. It is a special privilege to be here in the year that the American Congress welcomes its first woman Speaker, and its first Muslim-American member of Congress. These milestones send a message around the world about the America I know so well, a place where individuality is nurtured, a place where hard work is rewarded, a place where achievement is celebrated. The America I know so well believes that opportunity and justice belong to all. In my days in Massachusetts, I also learned something of New England virtues. There was not actually a law against talking too much, but there was definitely an attitude that you didn't speak unless you could improve on silence. Today, I must speak; I cannot be silent. I must speak about a cause that is urgent for your people and for mine. I must speak about peace in the Middle East. I must speak about peace replacing the division, war, and conflict that have brought such disaster for the region and for the world. This was the cause that brought my father King Hussein here in 1994. With Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin beside him, he spoke of a new vision for the Middle East. Their courageous work for peace received bipartisan support from your leaders. And there was tremendous hope for a new era. There was tremendous hope that people would be brought together. There was tremendous hope that a final and comprehensive settlement of all the issues would be achieved. Thirteen years later, that work is still not completed. And until it is, we are all at risk. We are all at risk of being victims of further violence resulting from ideologies of terror and hatred. It is our greatest and most urgent duty to prevent such dangers to our region, to your country and to the world. The choice is ours: an open world full of promise, progress, and justice for all; or a closed world of divided peoples, fear, and unfulfilled dreams. Nothing impacts this choice more than the future of peace in the Middle East. I come to you today at a rare, and indeed historic, moment of opportunity, when there is a new international will to end the catastrophe. And I believe that America, with its enduring values, its moral responsibility, and yes, its unprecedented power, must play the central role. Some may say, ‘Peace is difficult, we can live with the status quo.' But, my friends, violent killings are taking place as part of this status quo. Palestinians and Israelis are not the only victims. We saw the violence ricochet into destruction in Lebanon last summer. And people around the world have been the victims of terrorists and extremists, who use the grievances of this conflict to legitimize and encourage acts of violence. Americans and Jordanians and others have suffered and survived terrorist attacks. In this room, there are representatives of American families and Jordanian families who have lost loved ones. Thousands of people have paid the highest price, the loss of their life. Thousands more continue to pay this terrible price, for their loved ones will never return. Are we going to let these thousands of lives be taken in vain? Has it become acceptable to lose that most basic of human rights? The right to live? The status quo is also pulling the region and the world towards greater danger. As public confidence in the peace process has dropped, the cycle of crises is spinning faster, and with greater potential for destruction. Changing military doctrine and weaponry pose new dangers. Increasing numbers of external actors are intervening with their own strategic agendas, raising new dangers of proliferation and crisis. These are groups that seek even more division: faith against faith, nation against nation, community against community. Any further erosion in the situation would be serious for the future of moderation and coexistence, in the region and beyond. Have we all lost the will to live together in peace celebrating one another's strengths and differences? Some may say, ‘But there are other, urgent challenges.' How can there be anything more urgent than the restoration of a world where all people, not only some people, all people have the opportunity to live peacefully? This is not only a moral imperative, it is essential to the future of our world, because long-term, violent crisis is the enemy of all global prosperity and progress. Certainly, our era faces critical issues. There is great public concern here, just as in our region, about the conflict in Iraq. The entire international community has vital decisions to make about the path forward, and how to ensure Iraq's security, unity, and future. But we cannot lose sight of a profound reality. The wellspring of regional division, the source of resentment and frustration far beyond, is the denial of justice and peace in Palestine. There are those who say, ‘It's not our business.' But this Congress knows: there are no bystanders in the 21st Century, there are no curious onlookers, there is no one who is not affected by the division and hatred that is present in our world. Some will say: ‘This is not the core issue in the Middle East.' I come here today as your friend to tell you that this is the core issue. And this core issue is not only producing severe consequences for our region, it is producing severe consequences for our world. The security of all nations and the stability of our global economy are directly affected by the Middle East conflict. Across oceans, the conflict has estranged societies that should be friends. I meet Muslims thousands of miles away who have a deep, personal response to the suffering of the Palestinian people. They want to know how it is, that ordinary Palestinians are still without rights and without a country. They ask whether the West really means what it says about equality and respect and universal justice. Yes, my friends, today I must speak. I cannot be silent. Sixty years of Palestinian dispossession, forty years under occupation, a stop-and-go peace process, all this has left a bitter legacy of disappointment and despair, on all sides. It is time to create a new and different legacy, one that begins right now; one that can set a positive tone for the American and Middle East relationship; one that can restore hope to our region's people, to your people, and to the people of this precious world. Nothing can achieve that more effectively, nothing can assert America's moral vision more clearly, nothing can reach and teach the world's youth more directly, than your leadership in a peace process that delivers results not next year, not in five years, but this year. How do we get there? Not by a solution imposed by one side. A lasting peace can only be built on understanding, agreement, and compromise. It begins with courage and vision. We, all of us, must take risks for peace. The Arab states recognized that reality in 2002, when we unanimously approved the Arab Peace Initiative. It puts forward a path for both sides, to achieve what people want and need: a collective peace treaty with Israel and normal relations with every Arab state, collective security guarantees for all the countries of the region, including Israel, an end to the conflict, a dream every Israeli citizen has longed for since the creation of Israel, and an agreed solution to the refugee problem, a withdrawal from Arab territories occupied since 1967, and a sovereign, viable, and independent Palestine. The commitment we made in the Arab Peace Initiative is real. And our states are involved in ongoing efforts to advance a fair, just, and comprehensive peace. His Majesty King Abdullah Bin Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia initiated the 2002 proposal; today, he continues to rally international support. Momentum is also building among Muslim countries outside the Arab world. Ten days ago, in Islamabad, the foreign ministers of key Muslim states met. They came together to assure Palestinians and Israelis that they are not alone, that we back their effort to make and build peace. The goal must be a peace in which all sides gain. It must be anchored in security and opportunity for all. It must be a peace that will free young Palestinians to focus on a future of progress and prosperity. It must be a peace that makes Israel a part of the neighborhood, a neighborhood that extends from the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, across the breadth of the southern Mediterranean, to the coast of the Indian Ocean. It must be a peace that enables the entire region to look forward with excitement and hope, putting its resources into productive growth, partnering across borders to advance development, finding opportunities, and solving common challenges. This goal is visionary, but my friends, it is attainable. History shows that long-time adversaries can define new relationships of peace and cooperation. The groundwork for a comprehensive, final settlement is already in place. At Taba, as in the Geneva Accords, the parties have outlined the parameters of the solution. But we need all hands-on deck. The international community, especially the United States, must be engaged in moving the process forward to achieve real results. Above all, we must make our process serve our purpose. We must achieve an agreed solution to the conflict. Madam Speaker, Mr Vice President, Honourable Members, Your responsibility today is paramount. Your potential to help Palestinians and Israelis find peace is unrivalled. This is because the people of the region still regard the United States as the key to peace, the one country most capable of bringing the two sides closer together, holding them accountable, and making a just settlement reality. Time after time, there has been progress towards peace when Americans have actively engaged. Camp David, Madrid, Wye River: nearly every breakthrough was accomplished when America was determined to help the parties succeed. On behalf of all those who seek and strive for peace in my part of the world, I ask you now to exert that leadership once again. We ask you to join with us in an historic effort of courage and vision. We ask you to hear our call, to honor the spirit of King Hussein and Yitzhak Rabin, and help fulfil the aspirations of Palestinians and Israelis to live in peace today. Let me reaffirm that Jordan is committed to playing a positive role in the peace process. It is part of our larger commitment to global co-existence and progress. Ours is an Islamic country with a proud record of diversity, moderation, and shared respect. Allow me to say, we thank the Congress and the Administration for supporting Jordan's progress and development. I deeply value the partnership between our peoples, and the contributions of so many Americans to the future of our country. My friends, “A decent respect for the rights and dignity of all nations, large and small.” That's how President Roosevelt - the great F.D.R. - described the basis of American foreign policy. He pledged American support for the four freedoms, freedom from fear, freedom from want, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion, everywhere in the world. The Four Freedoms speech was given right here, before Congress. And that's entirely fitting. Because it is here in the People's House, that the voices and values of America have made hope real for so many people. Today, the people of the Middle East are searching for these four freedoms. Today, the people of the Middle East are searching for new hope, hope for a future of prosperity and peace. We have seen the danger and destruction of violence, hatred, and injustice. But we have also seen what people can achieve when they are empowered, when they break down walls, when they commit to the future. And we know that Middle East peace can be a global beginning, creating new possibilities for our region and the entire world. We look to you to play an historic role. Eleven American presidents and thirty American congresses have already faced this ongoing crisis. For not the future generation, but the generation alive today, let us say together: No more! Let us say together: Let's solve this! Let us say together: Yes, we will achieve this! No Palestinian father should be helpless to feed his family and build a future for his sons and daughters. No Israeli mother should fear when her child boards a bus. Not one more generation should grow up thinking that violence and conflict are the norm. As Roosevelt also said, “the justice of morality must and will win in the end.” But he knew that it was up to responsible nations to stand up for justice when injustice threatens. This is our challenge as well. And we must not leave it to another generation to meet this challenge. Thirteen years ago, my father was here to talk about his hopes for peace. Today, we are talking about a promise that is within our reach. We can wait no longer and that is why I am here before you. We must work together to restore Palestine, a nation in despair and without hope. We must work together to restore peace, hope and opportunity to the Palestinian people. And in so doing, we will begin a process of building peace, not only throughout the region, but throughout the world. How much more bloodshed and how many more lives will it cost for this grave situation to be resolved? I say: No more bloodshed and no more lives pointlessly taken! The young boy, travelling to school with his brother in Palestine, let him have a life of peace. The mother, watching with fear as her children board a bus in Israel, let her have a life of peace. The father in Lebanon, working hard to provide an education for his children, let him have a life of peace. The little girl, born in Iraq, with her wide eyes full of wonder, let her have a life of peace. The family, together eating their evening meal, in Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Europe, Australia, and the Middle East, let them all have a life of peace. Today my friends, we must speak; we cannot be silent. The next time a Jordanian, a Palestinian, or an Israeli comes before you, let it be to say: Thank you for helping peace become a reality. Thank you very much.",202,233,0,Democrat,49,49,2,Democrat,110
Dr. Nouri Al-Maliki,Republic of Iraq,645,7,2006,Prime Minister ,"In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Your Excellency the speaker of the House, Mr. Vice President, honorable ladies and gentlemen, members of Congress, it is with great pleasure that I am able to take this opportunity to be the first democratically and constitutionally elected prime minister of Iraq to address you, the elected representatives of the American people. And I thank you for affording me this unique chance to speak at this respected assembly. Let me begin by thanking the American people, through you, on behalf of the Iraqi people, for supporting our people in ousting dictatorship. Iraq will not forget those who stood with her – with him and who continues to stand with her in times of need. Thank you for your continued resolve in helping us fight the terrorists plaguing Iraq, which is a struggle to defend our nascent democracy and our people who aspire to liberty, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. All of those are not Western values; they are universal values for humanity. They are as much for me the pinnacle embodiment of my faith and religion, and they are for all free spirits. The war on terror is a real war against those who wish to burn out the flame of freedom, and we are in this vanguard for defending the values of humanity. I know that some of you here question whether Iraq is part of the war on terror. Let me be very clear -- this is a battle between true Islam, for which a person's liberty and rights constitute essential cornerstones, and terrorism, which wraps itself in a fake Islamic cloak; in reality, wages a war on Islam and Muslims and values and spreads hatred between humanity. Contrary to what's come in our Koran, which says we have created of you -- of male and female and made you tribes and families that you know each other, surely noblest of you in the sight of God is the best conduct. The truth is that terrorism has no religion. Our faith say that who kills an innocent as it has killed all mankind. Thousands of lives were tragically lost in September 11th, where -- when these imposters of Islam reared their ugly head. Thousands more continue to die in Iraq today at the hands of the same terrorists who show complete disregard for human life. Your loss on that day was the loss of all mankind, and our loss today is loss for all free people. And wherever human kind suffers a loss at the hands of terrorists, it is a loss of all humanity. It is your duty and our duty to defeat this terror. Iraq is the front line is this struggle, and history will prove that the sacrifices of Iraqis for freedom will not be in vain. Iraqis are your allies in the war on terror. And history will record their bravery and humanity. The fate of our country and yours is tied. Should democracy be allowed to fail in Iraq and terror permitted to triumph, then the war on terror will never be won elsewhere. Mr. Speaker, we are building the new Iraq on the foundation of democracy, and are erecting it through our belief in the rights of every individual, just as Saddam has destroyed it through his abuse of all those rights, so that future Iraqi generations can live in peace, prosperity and hope. Iraqis have tasted freedom, and we will defend it absolutely. Every human possesses inalienable rights which transcend religion, as it is stated in the International Convention of Human Rights. They transcend religion, race and gender, and God says in the Koran, and surely we have honored all children of Adam. I believe these human rights are not an artifact construct reserved for the few; they are the divine entitlement for all. And it is on this unwavering belief that we are determined to build our nation, a land whose people are free, whose air is liberty, and where the rule of law is supreme. This is the new Iraq, which is emerging from the ashes of dictatorship, and despite the carnage of extremists, a country which respects international conventions and practices non-interference in the internal affairs of others, relies on dialogue to resolve differences, and strives to develop strong relations with every country that espouses freedom and peace. We are working diligently so that Iraq returns to take the position it deserves and to play -- plays a positive role in its regional and international environment as a key, active player in spreading security and stability, to give an example of positive relationship between countries through denouncement of violence and resorting to constructive dialogue solving problems between nations and peoples. We have made progress, and we are correcting the damage inflicted by politics of the previous regime, in particular with our neighbors. My presence here is a testament of the new politics of a democratic Iraq. Ladies and gentlemen, in a short space of time, Iraq has gone from a dictatorship, to a transitional administration, and now to a fully fledged democratic government. This has happened despite the best efforts of the terrorists who are bent on either destroying democracy or Iraq. But by the courage of our people, who defied the terrorists every time they were called upon to make a choice by risking their lives for the ballot box, they have stated over and over again with their inked-stained fingers waving in pride that they will always make the same choice. Hope over fear - Hope over fear. Liberty over oppression. Dignity over submission. Democracy over dictatorship. Federalism over a centralist state. Let there be no doubt. Today Iraq is a democracy which stands firm because of the sacrifices of its people and the sacrifices of all those who stood with us in this crisis from nations and countries. And that's why I thank you. I would like to thank them very much for all their sacrifices. Iraqis of all persuasions took part in a unanimously democratic election for the first parliament formed under the country's first permanent constitution, after eight decades of temporary constitutions and dictatorship, a constitution written by the elected representatives of the people and ratified by the people. Iraqis succeeded in forming a government of national unity, based on an elected parliamentary foundation and includes all of Iraq's religions, ethnicities and political groupings. The journey has been perilous, and the future is not guaranteed. Yet many around the world who -- underestimated the resolve of Iraq's people and were sure that we would never reach this stage. Few believed in us. But you, the American people, did, and we are grateful for this. The transformation in Iraq can sometimes be forgotten in the daily futile violence. Since liberation we have witnessed great accomplishments in politics, the economy and civil society. We have gone from a one-party state ruled by a small elite to a multi-party system where politics is the domain of every citizen and parties compete at all levels. What used to be a state-controlled media is now completely free and uncensored -- something Iraq had never witnessed since its establishment as a modern state, and something which remains alien to most of the region. What used to be a command economy in Iraq we are rapidly transforming into a free market economy. In the past three years, our GDP per capita has more than doubled, and it is expected that our economy will continue to grow. Standards of living have been raised for most Iraqis as the markets witness an unprecedented level of prosperity. Many individuals are buying products and appliances which they would never have hoped to afford in the past. And in keeping with our economic visions of creating a free market economy, we will be presenting to parliament legislation which will lift current restrictions on foreign companies and investors who wish to come to Iraq. While we are making great economic strides, the greatest transformation has been on Iraqi society. We have gone from mass graves and torture chambers and chemical weapons to a flourishing -- to the rule of law and human rights. And the human rights and freedoms embodied in the new Iraq and consolidated in the constitution have provided a fertile environment for the ever-growing number of civil society institutions -- -- which are increasing in scope and complexity and provide a healthy reflection of what is developing beneath the violence. The rights chartered in the constitution will also help consolidate the role of women in public life as equals to men -- -- and help them to play a greater role in political life. I am proud to say that a quarter of Iraq's Council of Representatives is made up of women. But we still have much to accomplish. Mr. Vice President, our nascent democracy faces numerous challenges and impediments, but our resolve is unbreakable and we will overcome them. The greatest threat Iraq's people face is terror, terror inflicted by extremists who value no life and who depend on the fear their wanton murder and destruction creates. They have poured acid into Iraq's dictatorial wounds and created many of their own. Iraq is free and the terrorists cannot stand this. They hope to undermine our democratically elected government through the random killing of civilians. They want to destroy Iraq's future by assassinating our leading scientific, political and community leaders. Above all, they wish to spread fear. Do not think that this is an Iraqi problem. This terrorist front is a threat to every free country in the world and their citizens. What is at stake is nothing less than our freedom and liberty. Confronting and dealing with this challenge is the responsibility of every liberal democracy that values its freedom. Iraq is the battle that will determine the war. If in continued partnership we have the strength of mind and commitment to defeat the terrorists and their ideology in Iraq, they will never be able to recover. For the sake of success of the political process, I launched the National Reconciliation Initiative, which aims to draw in groups willing to accept the logic of dialogue and participation. This olive branch has received the backing of Iraq's parliamentary blocs and support further afield from large segments of the population. I remain determined to see this initiative succeed. But let our enemies not mistake our outstretched hand for forgiveness as a sign of weakness. Whoever chooses violence against the people of Iraq, then the fate that awaits them will be the same that of the terrorist Zarqawi. While political and economic efforts are essential, defeating terror in Iraq relies fundamentally on the building of sound Iraqi force, both in quantity and capability. The completion of Iraq's forces forms the necessary basis for the withdrawal of multinational forces, but it -- only then, only when Iraq's forces are fully capable will the job of the multinational forces be complete. Our Iraqi forces have accomplished much, and have gained a great deal of field experience to eventually enable them to triumph over the terrorists and to take over the security portfolio and extend peace through the country. The other impediment to Iraq's stability are the armed militias. I have on many occasions stated my determination to disband all militias, without exception -- and reestablish a state monopoly on arms, and to guarantee citizens security so that they do not need others to provide it. It is imperative that the reconstruction starts now. While small sections of central Iraq are unstable, large sections have remained peaceful but ignored for far too long. These were most deprived areas of Iraq under the previous regime, and have been the most valiant in Iraq's struggle for freedom. We need to make an example out of these stable areas as models for the rest of the country. Reconstruction projects in these areas will tackle unemployment, which will weaken the terrorists. They will become prototypes for other, more volatile regions to aspire to. Undoubtedly, reconstruction in these areas will fuel economic growth and show what a prosperous, stable, democratic and federal Iraq would look like. Members of the Congress, in this effort, we need your help. We need the help of the international community. Much of the budget you had allocated for Iraq's reconstruction ended up paying for security firms and foreign companies, whose operating costs were vast. Instead there needs to be a greater reliance on Iraqis and Iraqi companies, with foreign aid and assistance to help us rebuild Iraq. We are rebuilding Iraq on a new, solid foundation, that of liberty, hope and equality. Iraq's democracy is young, but the will of its people is strong. It is because of this spirit and desire to be free that Iraq has taken the opportunity you gave us, and we chose democracy. We faced tyranny and oppression under the former regime, and we now face a different kind of terror. We did not bow then, and we will not bow now. I will not allow Iraq to become a launch pad for al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. I will not -- terror rob Iraqis of their hopes and dreams. I will not allow terrorists to dictate to us our future. For decades we struggled alone for our freedom. In 1991, when Iraqis tried to capitalize on the regime's momentary weakness and rose up, we were alone again. The people of Iraq will not forget your continued support as we establish a secure, liberal democracy. Let 1991 never be repeated, for history will be more unforgiving. The coming few days are difficult and the challenges are considerable. Iraq and America both need each other to defeat the terror engulfing the free world. In partnership, we will be triumphant because we will never be slaves to terror, for God has made us free. Trust that Iraq will be a grave for terrorism and terrorists. Trust that Iraq will be the graveyard for terrorism and terrorists, for all -- for the good of all humanity. Thank you very much.",233,201,1,Republican,55,44,1,Republican,109
Vaira Vike-Freiberga,Republic of Latvia,367,6,2006,President ,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, distinguished members of the House of Representatives, honorable senators, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen: It is with deep emotion that I've found within these august halls and thank you for the honor of addressing you on behalf of the Latvian people. I believe this honor to be bestowed upon me in recognition of Latvia's striving, sacrifices, and extraordinary success in transforming itself from a captive nation under the yoke of a foreign totalitarian regime into a reestablished democracy with a flourishing market economy. Fifteen years ago, Latvia, along with neighboring Estonia and Lithuania, regained its independence after 50 years of Soviet occupation. The Baltic Singing Revolution achieved it by nonviolent means, by the sheer courage and determination of the peoples of these countries. They were ready to face Soviet guns and tanks with nothing but their unarmed bodies and a deep conviction of their rights, knowing full well that at any moment these guns and tanks might crush them, as they have crushed so many before. After the collapse of the once-powerful Soviet empire, Latvians at long last recovered their fundamental rights and freedoms. They regained the right to forge their own destiny. They recovered the freedom to shape their own future. For too long, the Iron Curtain had kept Europe divided, and the nations of the world confronted each other in two opposing camps. We thank the Lord that these times are behind us at last. Dozens of nations have gained or regained their sovereignty. For them, right has triumphed over might; courage has overcome fear; and dignity has replaced humiliation and oppression. The wave of freedom and democratic reform has been spreading throughout Central and Eastern Europe, extending from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea and into the Caucasus. One country after another, with a sad exception, Belarus, has been making a commitment to democracy, and has accepted the need for the rule of law and the respect of human rights. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, distinguished members of Congress, it is an honor and a pleasure to be addressing you as the elected representatives of a great country, a mighty world power that has achieved its greatness by building its house on the solid rock of democracy. The United States of America has remained ever faithful to Lincoln's goal of having a government of the people, for the people and by the people. Born 230 years ago, your great nation has grown strong by being a warm and welcoming mother of exiles, as well as a land of hope and opportunity for its own sons and daughters. Among the exiles received in America, there are many Latvians who had fled their native land at the end of the Second World War. Latvia remains grateful to the United States for opening its doors to a good many of these exiles, who gained the right to live here in peace, justice and liberty, while many of their relatives back home suffered oppression and brutal persecutions. They quickly became loyal and patriotic citizens of America, productive members of your society, many achieving positions of distinction and responsibility. Latvia remains grateful to the United States for the firm refusal to recognize the illegal occupation of the three Baltic countries. Along with the other formerly captive nations of Central and Eastern Europe, we thank America for its steadfast and courageous stand on freedom and democracy. You were instrumental in assisting Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania in the withdrawal of former Soviet troops from their territories. The U.S.-Baltic Charter of Partnership of 1998 gave direction to our common goal and vision of the Baltic states joining Euro-Atlantic institutions. We recall the unanimous vote by the United States Senate in support of the latest enlargement of NATO. Since then, the United States has helped to ensure the collective defense of the Baltic airspace. For all this, we are grateful. Latvia has had the honor of receiving two American presidents since recovering its independence: President Clinton, in 1994, and President Bush last year. We look forward to receiving President Bush again this fall when the 2006 NATO Summit convenes in Riga. We count ourselves fortunate to have the United States of America as a true friend and trusted ally. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, distinguished members of Congress, I stand before you as a former exile who has had the rare privilege of returning to her native land free and independent again, a former exile who has had the deep satisfaction of helping her country rise like a phoenix from the ashes of oppression, I am the representative of a resilient and stubborn nation whose people have struggled against all odds to preserve their ancient heritage, maintain their language alive and remain true to their national identity. It has been indeed a privilege to lead this nation while it recovered its rightful place among the world community of free and democratic countries. The road has not been easy. Renewing independence was just the first step. We still had to rebuild a country, not just starting from scratch, but after clearing away the rubble left by the previous system. Just 15 years ago, we had to make the transition from a stagnant, state-planned, command economy to a workable, liberal, free- market economy. It was a formidable challenge. While we were fortunate in regaining our independence without significant bloodshed, our inhabitants did pay a heavy economic and social price for their freedom. They were ready to do so because they understood that this was an investment into a better future. Overcoming years of constant change, uncertainty and adaptation, Latvia has become a success story; an unfinished story by all means, especially as concerns the standard of living of our people, but a success story, nevertheless. Last year, Latvia's economy grew by more than 10 percent, and this year, my country continues to maintain the highest economic growth rate on the European continent. We are on our way, ready to share our experience and pass it on to others. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, distinguished members of Congress, what has helped Latvia and its Baltic neighbors succeed, where so many others are failing in spite of not just years, but decades of help and encouragement of every kind? It was above all the faith of the Baltic nations in the values of freedom and democracy. It was their firm and irreversible determination to build a new and better future for their children and grandchildren. They wanted to rejoin the free world from which they had been cut off for half a century. What urged us on was our ardent desire to make up for lost time, to catch up with those Western European countries that have enjoyed the freedom of growing and striving ever since the end of the second world war. The desire to join NATO and the European Union became a force driving us forward as strong as the force driving us away from the past under Soviet dictatorship. This clear sense of purpose allowed us to transform our institutions and to reform our economy. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, distinguished members of Congress, the challenge ever since the fall of the Soviet empire and the breakup of the former Yugoslavia has been to rebuild a Europe whole and free: a Europe free of dividing lines, of feudal dependencies, of imperialist spheres of influence; a Europe free from blood-thirsty ideologies and from murderous fanatics. We need a Europe without walls, barriers, exclusion or prejudice, a Europe in which every nation would be afforded equal dignity and would be treated with equal respect. All Europeans, after all, are part of the same old continent, and all of them need to work together to make it eternally new. Such a Europe is not and must not be a counterforce to the influence of the United States. It is and must continue to be an ally and a partner. All Europeans share the same fundamentals of the same cultural heritage, a heritage that is also shared by Americans. This heritage includes outstanding achievements as well as resounding failures. A common European space of peace and stability, of economic growth and prosperity, is the best guarantee that the Europe of the 21st century will never again repeat the errors and the horrors of the 20th. We have seen the depths to which Europe could sink, as well as the heights to which it could rise. Never again should we allow such horrors as the Holocaust to be repeated. We need to aim for the heights and to help each other achieve them. Yet it is perfectly true that Latvia, along with other Central and Eastern European countries, feels a special bond of friendship and affinity with the United States. We might as well admit it. We, who had lost our liberty, look up to those who are ready to defend it. But, if the bond of trust and friendship between the U.S. and the newer members of the EU and NATO is to be deepened, strengthened and maintained, we do need more face-to-face contacts between our peoples, we need more possibilities of visits and mutual exchanges. I trust that U.S. Congress will find a non-discriminatory solution for extending the visa waiver program to all its allies in a united Europe. Such a step would be broadly welcomed as a signal of growing maturity in the alliance between our nations. We are partners even though we differ in size and influence, in power, in resources. We are partners even while having different opinions on certain issues; that, after all, is the whole point of living in democracies. Any disagreements must not steer us off our common course of consolidating peace and security in the world. My country sees Europe's transatlantic partnership with the United States as essential for our common security, as well as for maintaining the security of the world at large. The U.S. has been a trusted partner whenever European liberties were endangered, and proved it through the sacrifice of the lives of its soldiers. Throughout the decades of the Cold War, Western Europe was kept safe under the protection of NATO and through the significant role of American military capability. This coming November, Latvia will host the 2006 NATO Summit in its capital city of Riga. This will be a summit about the rejuvenation and the transformation of NATO, which remains the most powerful and effective military alliance in the whole world. We need a strong and vibrant alliance able to face up effectively to the challenges of our age. The nature of threats may change, but the danger they pose does not. NATO is not only about protecting its members within their own borders. We are ready to work closely with the United States and other willing partners to aid those strife-ridden countries whose fragility is a bane for their own people and a threat to the rest of the world. Right now, Latvia is contributing to international peacekeeping operations in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Bosnia, in Kosovo and elsewhere. Latvia's contribution is proportionately one of the largest in the world in terms of the country's size and available financial resources. From its very inception, NATO has been more than just a military alliance. That is why more and more nations are expressing their desire to join it. We support the strivings for freedom, democracy and the rule of law of countries struggling with the after-effects of imposed totalitarianism. Latvia supports Ukraine and Georgia in their endeavors to establish closer relations with NATO. We encourage the member states of the alliance to formulate concrete and enhanced forms of cooperation between NATO and these two countries at the Riga summit. We firmly believe that an open-door policy must be maintained for the admittance of future member states. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, distinguished members of Congress, one nation with which Latvia shares a common border, as well as a complicated history, is Russia. Last year marked the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. This victory brought freedom to one half of Europe but not to the other. After being Hitler's partner for two years, Stalin had joined the allies in ridding Europe of this bloodthirsty tyrant. In recognition of that role, and in homage to the immense losses and casualties that the Russian people endured during the Second World War, I accepted the invitation of the president of the Russian Federation and traveled to Moscow on May 9th of last year. But I also pointed out that this victory over one despot still kept the other one in power. For the people of Latvia, one foreign occupation was only replaced by another. No one gained freedom under Stalinist tyranny and the oppression of totalitarian Communism. This is not rewriting history; these are plain facts. The simple acknowledgment and recognition of them would go a long way towards strengthening trust, understanding and good-neighborly relations between our nations. Latvia, for its part, stands ready for developing a friendly, future-oriented and pragmatic relationship with Russia as an important neighbor of the EU. We stand ready for an active and meaningful political dialogue based on mutual respect, non-interference, and the true respect for human rights. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, distinguished representatives of the American people, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, the United States of America has a crucial role to play in the international arena. The United States has been a beacon of liberty ever since its foundation. The United States has become a world power by giving free rein to the creativity, the initiative and the energy of its people, by fostering their entrepreneurial spirit. But the United States has become a world leader only to the extent that it has not been indifferent to the fates, the aspirations and the opinions of other nations. For as no man is an island, neither is any country alone and self-sufficient. All of us, large and small, are interlocked, intertwined and interdependent. If we want peace in the world, if we want international cooperation, persuasion is as important as imposition by force. Smaller and weaker nations want to be meaningfully included in decisions that will affect us all. They want to be respected. When they clamor for multilateralism, nations are really saying, ""Listen to me. I want to be heard."" Of course, among all this clamor it may be hard to find a common denominator. It's not always easy to achieve a common purpose. We see this all too clearly in the difficulties that the United Nations are experiencing in bringing about all the reforms agreed to in principle during the General Assembly of their 60th anniversary year. As a special envoy of the secretary-general in the reform of the United Nations last year, I was pleased that the General Assembly managed to agree in principle on the necessity of sweeping and fundamental reforms. The new peace-building commission was created, which we need for defusing long-lasting conflict. Too often in the past, the U.N. has been unable to prevent genocide and lasting bloodshed -- in the Congo, in Rwanda, in the former Yugoslavia, and now in the Darfur region of Sudan. One of the U.N.'s fundamental roles lies in the defense of human rights. The newly created Human Rights Council must become more credible and more effective than the commission that preceded it. Its best way to gain credibility would be by starting with a thorough an unbiased evaluation of the human rights record of its own newly elected council members. Only through a concerted international effort based on consensus and cooperation will the world community be able to overcome a number of other pressing global challenges. The degradation of our planet's environment is truly a global problem, as is the spread of epidemic disease. Most dangerous of all is the continuing and growing gap between the developing and the developed nations. The great divide between North and South, between haves and have nots is as dangerous as the divide between Eastern and Western blocs there was during the Cold War. We have to do our utmost to reach the U.N.'s Millennium Goals of reducing poverty in the developing world.  Brutal and unremitting poverty is a scourge unsolved, in spite of decades of massive international aid and countless well-meant programs. Clearly, the quality of governance in aid-receiving countries has a crucial role to play as well as their readiness to foster reforms and start progress. But the quality of aid providing efforts also needs to be improved. We need better international coordination of results-oriented programs, which should be constantly monitored for their effectiveness. The worldwide spread of terrorism as well as the growing signs of intolerance and xenophobia in many countries underscore the urgent worldwide need for a meaningful and sustained dialogue of civilizations. As already recognized, the Millennium General Assembly of the United Nations, our common goal is to overcome the prejudice, misperceptions, the polarizations, the standard barriers to better understanding and consensus among the members of different races, religions and cultures. Due to the enormous importance of nuclear nonproliferation, the world's democracies should maintain a coherent position regarding the nuclear program of Iran. We welcome the recent joint initiatives by the United States, the United Nations Security Council and the European Union to offer a constructive solution to the Iranian nuclear issue and hope that the Iranian leadership will respond in kind. The long-standing conflict in the Middle East remains a major source of world tensions. We fully empathize with the desire of the Jewish people to live on their ancestral land in security and at peace with their neighbors. We also wish to see a free and prosperous Palestinian state co- exist peacefully side by side with the state of Israel. For this to be achieved, the Hamas-led Palestinian administration must abide by previously signed international agreements. There is no other way. Education could play an important role in immunizing our societies against the dangers of extremism and prejudice. Children should not be raised in hatred, so far as we should have more constructive goals to end this cultivation of grievances and the stark division of the human race into us and them. Every society has experienced some dark events in its history; at times, as victim, at others, as perpetrator or a collaborator. We must inform our children of our past mistakes so that these may never be repeated again. An objective evaluation of the legacy of the past will free us to address the challenges of the future. We in Latvia believe in the importance of research, remembrance, education, even on the most sensitive issues. This includes the crimes of the Holocaust, when Latvia was under Nazi German occupation as well as the crimes committed in the name of communism under the Soviet occupation regime. It is also the duty of each country to preserve its historic, cultural and religious heritage. Latvia is a country with a multiethnic and multireligious mosaic. We are proud of our ethnic communities and of the contributions that our sons and daughters have made to Latvia's human, economic and cultural development. As a pluralistic and flourishing democracy, we enjoy freedom of religion and have been gradually renewing the houses of worship of different faiths, including the many desecrated Lutheran churches, desecrated in the communist times. Soon after recovering our independence, we received a visit by Pope John Paul II. Last month, the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, Alexy II, paid a historic visit to my country. Just recently, with the support of the U.S. government and the family of the late Latvian-born painter Mark Rothko, I attended the reconsecration ceremony of a reconstructed Jewish synagogue in the city of Daugavpils. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, distinguished members of Congress, fanaticism and extremism remain a scourge of humanity as they have been for many centuries. Violence and hatred continue to plague many nations and block the road to achieving progress. Greed, opportunism and brute force oppress many peoples and deny them the most basic of rights. Just as clearly, the world also knows charity, compassion, the desire for kindness. Human beings everywhere are capable of change and change for the better. Again and again in history we have seen the victory of freedom over tyranny, exploitation and chaos. It may take decades, as it did for Latvia, but we did gain the freedom that is ours by right. We know the value of freedom and feel compassion for those who are still deprived of it. We know the price of freedom, for we have paid for it, and we would be ready to do it again and again. Every nation on Earth is entitled to freedom. It is a dream that must be kept alive no matter how long it takes or how hard it is to achieve. We must share the dream that some day there won't be a tyranny left anywhere in the world. We must work for a future where every nation on Earth will have thrown off the shackles of injustice and of oppression, and where every person on Earth will enjoy the same rights and liberties that now are the privilege of the more democratic and the more developed countries. It will take time, it will take effort, but it must happen. And it will happen all the sooner the better we learn to work for it and plan for it, all of us, large and small, together.",233,201,1,Republican,55,44,1,Republican,109
Ehud Olmert,State of Israel,666,5,2006,Prime Minister,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, distinguished members of the U.S. Congress, ladies and gentlemen: On behalf of the people in the state of Israel, I wish to express my profound gratitude to you for your privilege of addressing this joint meeting of the U.S. Congress. This building, this chamber, and all of you stand as a testament to the enduring principles of liberty and democracy. More than 30 years ago, I came to Washington as a young legislator thanks to a program sponsored by the State Department. I had a chance to tour this building, and I saw then what I believe today, that this institution, the United States Congress, is the greatest deliberative body of the world. I did not imagine then that a day would actually come when I would have the honor of addressing this forum as the prime minister of my nation, the state of Israel. Thank you. The United States is a superpower whose influence reaches across oceans and beyond borders. Your continued support, which I am happy to say transcends parties and affiliations, is of paramount importance to us. We revere the principles and values represented by your great country and are grateful for the unwavering support and friendship we have received from the U.S. Congress, from President George W. Bush, and from the American people. Abraham Lincoln once said, ""I am a success today because I had a friend who believed in me and I didn't have the heart to let him down."" Israel is grateful that America believes in us. Let me assure you that we will not let you down. Thank you. The similarities in our economic, social and cultural identities are obvious, but there is something much deeper and everlasting. The unbreakable ties between our two nations extend far beyond mutual interests. They are based on our shared goals and values stemming from the very essence of our mutual foundations. This coming Monday, the 29th of May, you commemorate Memorial Day for America's fallen. The graves of brave American soldiers are scattered throughout the world, in Asia and in the Pacific, throughout Europe and Africa, in Iraq and throughout the Middle East. The pain of the families never heals and the void they leave is never filled. It is impossible to think of a world in which America was not there in the honorable service of humanity. On Monday, when the stars and the stripes are lowered to half mast, we, the people of Israel, will bow our heads for you. Our two great nations share a profound belief in the importance of freedom and a common pioneering spirit deeply rooted in optimism. It was the energetic spirit of our pioneers that enabled our two countries to implement the impossible: to build cities where swamps once existed and to make the desert bloom. My parents, Bella and Mordechai Olmert, were lucky. They escaped the persecutions in the Ukraine and Russia and found sanctuary in Harbin, China. They immigrated to Israel to fulfill their dream of building a Jewish and democratic state living in peace in the land of our ancestors. My parents came to the holy land following a verse in the Old Testament, in the Book of 2 Samuel: ""I will appoint a place for my people, Israel, and I will plant them in their land, and they will dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more."" Distinguished members of Congress, I come here to this home of liberty and democracy to tell you that my parents' dream, our dream, has only been partly fulfilled. We have succeed in building a Jewish democratic homeland. We have succeeded in creating an oasis of hope and opportunity in a troubled region. But there has not been one year, one week, even one day of peace in our tortured land. Our Israeli pioneers suffered and their struggle was long and hard. Yet even today, almost 60 years after our independence, that struggle still endures. Since the birth of the state of Israel and until this very moment, we have been continually at war and amidst confrontation. The confrontation has become even more violent, the enemy turned even more inhumane due to the scourge of suicide terrorism. But we are not alone. Today, Israel, America, Europe and democracies across the globe, unfortunately, face this enemy. Over the past six years, more than 20,000 attempted terrorist attacks have been initiated against the people of Israel. Most, thankfully, have been foiled by our security forces. But those which have succeeded have resulted in the death of hundreds of innocent civilians and the injury of thousands, many of them children guilty only of being in what proved to be the wrong place at the wrong time. These are not statistics; these are real people with beautiful souls that have left this Earth far too soon. In the decade I served as mayor of my beloved city Jerusalem, we faced the lion's share of the seemingly endless wave of terrorism. I remember Galila, a 12-year-old Ethiopian immigrant whose parents worked in the King David Hotel. On one particular morning her parents, overwhelmed by the fear of riding a bus in the city of Jerusalem, told their daughter: ""Galila, perhaps this morning, just this morning, we'll take you in the family car to your school."" And Galila said to her parents, ""Oh, come on. Don't be silly. I know where to sit in the bus. I will be safe in the bus. Don't worry for me."" And it so happened that on that same day the suicide attacker ascended to that same bus and chose to sit just next to her. When I visited her grieving parents, her mother came to me sobbing and she said: ""You are the mayor. You have so much influence in this city. Will you do us just one last favor: Please try to find out something, just one item of remembrance that we will be able to take with us for the rest of our lives. Maybe just a shoelace of Galila's."" And I did everything a mayor could do. I summoned the police, I summoned the security forces, I instructed the municipal workers, I told them: Go look out everywhere you can. And then they came back and they say to me: Mr. Mayor, nothing, nothing, not even a shoelace. Among the victims of this brutal and unremitting terror, I am sorry to tell you, are also American citizens. Only last week, Daniel Cantor Wultz, a 16-years-old high school student from western Florida, who came to spend the Passover holiday with his parents in Israel, succumbed to his severe injuries incurred in Israel's most recent suicide attack. I asked Daniel's parents and sister, Yekutiel, Cheryl and Amanda Wultz, who only finished the traditional period of mourning two days ago, to be with us here today. Daniel was a relative of Congressman Eric Cantor of Virginia, an honorable member of this house. Our thoughts and prayers are with you. I bring Galili's memory, Daniel's memory, and the loss of so many others with me to my new post as prime minister.I also bring with me the horrific scenes I saw with my own eyes when I visited New York just a few days after the devastating attacks on September 11th, a tragedy that  transcends any other terrorist attack that has ever occurred. As I told my good friend Rudy Giuliani, on that dreadful day our hearts went out to you, not only because of the friendship between us, but because, tragically and personally, we both know what it is to confront the evil of terrorism at home. Our countries do not just share the experience and pain of terrorism, we share the commitment and resolve to confront the brutal terrorists that took these innocent people from us. We share the commitment to extract from our grief a renewed dedication to providing our people with a better future. Let me state this as clearly as I can: We will not yield to terror. We will not surrender to terror. We will not surrender to terror, and we will win the war on terror and restore peace to our societies. The Palestinian Authority is ruled by Hamas, an organization committed to vehement anti-Semitism, the glorification of terror and the total destruction of Israel. As long as these are their guiding principles, they can never be a partner. Therefore, while Israel works to ensure that the humanitarian needs of the Palestinian populations are met, we can never capitulate to terrorists or terrorism.I pay tribute to the firmness and the clarity with which the president and this Congress uphold this crucial principle which we both firmly share. Israel commends this Congress for initiating the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act, which sends a firm, clear message that the United States of America will not tolerate terrorism in any form. Like America, Israel seeks to rid itself of the horrors of terrorism. Israel yearns for peace and security. Israel is determined to take responsibility for its own future and take concrete steps to turn its dreams into reality. The painful but necessary process of disengagement from the Gaza Strip and northern Samaria was an essential step. At this moment, my thoughts turn especially to the great leader, who in normal circumstances should have stood here. Ariel Sharon, the legendary statesman and visionary, my friend and colleague, could not be here with us, but I am emboldened by the promise of continuing his mission. I pray, as I am sure you all do, too, for his recovery. Ariel Sharon was a man of few words and great principles. His vision and dream of peace and security transcended time, philosophy and politics. Israel must still meet the momentous challenge of guaranteeing the future of Israel as a democratic state with a Jewish majority, within permanent and defensible borders, and a united Jerusalem as its capital that is open and accessible for the worship of all religions. This was the dream to which Ariel Sharon was loyally committed. This was the mission he began to fulfill. It is the goal and the purpose of the Kadima party that he founded and to which I was the first to join. And it is this legacy of liberty, identity and security that I embrace. It is what I am working towards. It is what I am so passionately hoping for. Although our government has changed, Israel's goal remains the same. As Prime Minister Sharon clearly stated: ""The Palestinians will forever be our neighbors. They are an inseparable part of this land, as are we. Israel has no desire to rule over them, nor to oppress them. They too have a right for freedom and national inspirations. With the vision of Ariel Sharon guiding my actions, from this podium today, I extend my hand in peace to Mahmoud Abbas, elected President of the Palestinian Authority. On behalf of the State of Israel, we are willing to negotiate with a Palestinian Authority. This authority must renounce terrorism, dismantle the terrorist infrastructure, accept previous agreements and commitments, and recognize the right of Israel to exist. Let us be clear: peace, without security, will bring neither peace nor security. We will not, we cannot, compromise on these basic tests of partnership. With a genuine Palestinian partner for peace, I believe we can reach an agreement on all the issues that divide us. Our past experience shows us it is possible to bridge the differences between our two peoples. I believe this - I KNOW THIS - because we have done it before, in our peace treaties with Egypt and with Jordan. These treaties involved painful and difficult compromises. It required Israel to take real risks.But if there is to be a just, fair and lasting peace, we need a partner who rejects violence and who values life more than death. We need a partner that affirms in action, not just in words, the rejection, prevention and elimination of terror. Peace with Egypt became possible only after President Anwar Sadat came to our Knesset and declared, once and for all, ""No more war and no more bloodshed."" And peace with Jordan became possible only after the late King Hussein, here in Washington, declared the end of the state of belligerency, signed a peace treaty with us, and wholeheartedly acknowledged Israel's right to exist. The lesson for the Palestinian people is clear. In a few years they could be living in a Palestinian state, side by side in peace and security with Israel. A Palestinian State which Israel and the international community would help thrive. But no one can make this happen for them if they refuse to make it happen for themselves. For thousands of years, we Jews have been nourished and sustained by a yearning for our historic land. I, like many others, was raised with a deep conviction that the day would never come when we would have to relinquish parts of the land of our forefathers. I believed, and to this day still believe, in our people's eternal and historic right to this entire land. But I also believe that dreams alone will not quiet the guns that have fired unceasingly for nearly a hundred years. Dreams alone will not enable us to preserve a secure democratic Jewish state. Jews all around the world read in this week's Torah portion: ""And you will dwell in your land safely and I will give you peace in the land, and there shall be no cause for fear neither shall the sword cross through the Promised Land"". Painfully, we the people of Israel have learned to change our perspective. We have to compromise in the name of peace, to give up parts of our promised land in which every hill and valley is saturated with Jewish history and in which our heroes are buried. We have to relinquish part of our dream to leave room for the dream of others, so that all of us can enjoy a better future. For this painful but necessary task my government was elected. And to this I am fully committed. We hope and pray that our Palestinian neighbors will also awaken. We hope they will make the crucial distinction between implementing visions that can inspire us to build a better reality, and mirages that will only lead us further into the darkness. We hope and pray for this, because no peace is more stable than one reached out of mutual understanding not just for the past but for the future. We owe a quiet and normal life to ourselves, our children and our grandchildren. After defending ourselves for almost 60 years against attacks, all our children should be allowed to live free of fear and terror. And so I ask of the Palestinians: How can a child growing up in a Culture of Hate dream of the possibility of peace? It is so important that all schools and all educational institutions in the region teach our children to be hate-free. The key to a true lasting peace in the Middle East is in the education of the next generation. So let us today call out to all peoples of the Middle East: replace the Culture of Hate with an outlook of hope. It is three years since the Road Map for Peace was presented. The Road Map was and remains the right plan. A Palestinian leadership that fulfils its commitments and obligations will find us a willing partner in peace. But if they refuse, we will not give a terrorist regime a veto over progress, or allow it to take hope hostage.We cannot wait for the Palestinians forever. Our deepest wish is to build a better future for our region, hand in hand with a Palestinian partner, but if not, we will move forward, but not alone. We could never have implemented the Disengagement plan without your firm support. The Disengagement could never have happened without the commitments set out by President Bush in his letter of April 14, 2004, endorsed by both houses of Congress in unprecedented majorities. In the name of the People of Israel, I thank President Bush for this commitment and for his support and friendship. The next step is even more vital to our future and to the prospects of finally bringing peace to the Middle East. Success will only be possible with America as an active participant, leading the support of our friends in Europe and across the world. Should we realize that the bilateral track with the Palestinians is of no consequence, should the Palestinians ignore our outstretched hand for peace, Israel will seek other alternatives to promote our future and the prospects of hope in the Middle East. At that juncture, the time for realignment will occur. Realignment would be a process to allow Israel to build its future without being held hostage to Palestinian terrorist activities. Realignment would significantly reduce the friction between Israelis and Palestinians and prevent much of the conflict between our two battered nations. The goal is to break the chains that have tangled our two peoples in unrelenting violence for far too many generations. With our futures unbound peace and stability might finally find its way to the doorsteps of this troubled region. Mr. Speaker, Allow me to turn to another dark and gathering storm casting its shadow over the world…. Every generation is confronted with a moment of truth and trial. From the savagery of slavery, to the horrors of World War Two, to the gulags of the Communist Bloc. That which is right and good in this world has always been at war with the horrific evil permitted by human indifference. Iran, the world's leading sponsor of terror, and a notorious violator of fundamental human rights, stands on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons. With these weapons, the security of the entire world is put in jeopardy. We deeply appreciate America's leadership on this issue and the strong bipartisan conviction that a nuclear-armed Iran is an intolerable threat to the peace and security of the world. It cannot be permitted to materialize. This Congress has proven its conviction by initiating the Iran Freedom and Support Act. We applaud these efforts. A nuclear Iran means a terrorist state could achieve the primary mission for which terrorists live and die: the mass destruction of innocent human life. This challenge, which I believe is The Test of Our Time, is one the West cannot afford to fail. The radical Iranian regime has declared the United States its enemy. Its President believes it is his religious duty and his destiny to lead his country in a violent conflict against the infidels. With pride he denies the Jewish Holocaust and speaks brazenly, calling to wipe Israel off the map. For us, this is an existential threat. A threat to which we cannot consent. But it is not Israel's threat alone. It is a threat to all those committed to stability in the Middle East and the well being of the world at large. Mr. Speaker, our moment is NOW. History will judge our generation by the actions we take NOW…by our willingness to stand up for peace and security and freedom, and by our courage to do what is right.The international community will be measured not by its intentions but by its results. The international community will be judged by its ability to convince nations and peoples to turn their backs on hatred and zealotry. If we don't take Iran's bellicose rhetoric seriously now, we will be forced to take its nuclear aggression seriously later.Mr. Speaker, The true Israel is not one you can understand through the tragic experiences of the complex geopolitical realities. Israel has impressive credentials in the realms of science, technology, high-tech and the arts and many Israelis are Nobel Prizes laureates in various fields. A land with limited resources, eager to facilitate cooperation with the United States, Israel devotes its best and brightest scientists to Research and Development for new generations of safe, reliable, efficient and environmentally friendly sources of energy. Both our countries share a desire for energy security and prevention of global warming. Therefore, through the United States - Israel energy cooperation act and other joint frameworks, in collaboration with our US counterparts, Israel will increase its efforts to find advanced scientific and technological solutions, designed to develop new energy sources and encourage conservation. Just one example of Israel's remarkable achievements is the recent 4 billion dollar purchase by an American company of Israel's industrial giant Iscar. This is an important endorsement of the Israeli economy, which has more companies listed on NASDAQ than any country other than the United States and Canada. It is also a vote of confidence in Israel's strategic initiative to enhance the economic and social development of our Negev and Galilee regions. But above all it is recognition that what unites us, Israel and America, is a commitment to tap the greatest resource of all - the human mind and the human spirit. We believe in the moral principles shared by our two nations and they guide our political decisions. We believe that life is sacred and fanaticism is not. We believe that every democracy has the right and the duty to defend its citizens and its values against all enemies. We believe that terrorism not only leads to war but that terrorism is war. A war that must be won every day. A war in which all men and women of goodwill must be allies. We believe that peace among nations remains not just the noblest ideal but a genuine reality. We believe that peace, based on mutual respect, must be and is attainable in the near future We, as Jews and citizens of Israel, believe that our Palestinian neighbors want to live in peace. We believe that they have the desire, and hopefully the courage, to reject violence and hatred as means to attain national independence. The Bible tells us that as Joshua stood on the verge of the Promised Land, he was given one exhortation: 'Chazak Ve'ematz' 'Be strong and of good courage"".Strength, without courage, will only lead to brutality. Courage, without strength, will only lead to futility. Only genuine courage and commitment to our values, backed by the will and the power to defend them, will lead us forward in the service of humanity. To the Congress of the United States and to the great people of America, I wish to say 'Chazak Ve'ematz' be strong and of good courage, and we, and all peoples who cherish freedom, will be with you. And God Bless America, Thank you.",233,201,1,Republican,55,44,1,Republican,109
Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,Republic of Liberia ,450,3,2006,President,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of the United States Congress, distinguished guests: I am deeply touched by the honor bestowed on my small but proud West African Republic of Liberia, and on myself by inviting me to address this Body of Representatives of the people of the great United States of America. By this invitation, you have paid one of the greatest tributes there is to those who laid down their lives for my country to be free and democratic. I can only say a big thank you. The people of Liberia and the people of the United States are bound together by history and by values. We share a deep and abiding belief in the power of freedom, of faith, of finding virtue in work for the common good. The national motto of Liberia, founded, as you know, by freed American slaves, is ""The Love of Liberty Brought Us Here."" We became the first independent Republic in Africa. Our capital, Monrovia, is named for your President, James Monroe. Our flag is a star in a blue field and red and white stripes; its one star makes us the ""lone star state in Africa."" Our Constitution and our laws are based upon yours. The -- The U.S. dollar was long legal tender and still is used alongside the Liberian dollar today. But our ties greatly exceed the historical connection. I stand before you today, as the first woman elected to lead an African nation, thanks to the grace of Almighty God; thanks to the courage of the Liberian people, who chose their future over fear; thanks to the people of West Africa and of Africa generally, who continued to give hope to my people; thanks also to President W. Bush whose strong resolve and public condemnation and appropriate action forced a tyrant into exile; and thanks to you, the members of this august body, who spurred the international effort that brought blessed peace to our nation. It was the leadership of the 108th Congress, more than two years ago, that paved the way for a United Nations force that secured our peace and guaranteed free and fair elections. It was your 445 million dollars addition to a supplemental appropriation that attracted additional commitments from international donors. With those funds, we have laid the foundation for a durable peace, not only in Liberia, but in the whole West African sub-region. Special appreciation goes to the 109th Congress, those of you in this room, for the effort in recent weeks to meet Liberia's development needs. Honorable ladies and gentlemen of this Congress, I want to thank you. The Liberian people have sent me here to thank you. Thank you for your vision. Our triumph over evil is also your triumph. Our special relationship with the United States brought us benefits long before the autumn of 2003. Thousands of our people, including myself, have been educated in American missionary schools and gone on to higher training in this country. You have generously welcomed tens of thousands of our people as they fled war and persecution. I was among them. In 1985, after challenging the military's regime failure to register my political party, I was put in jail with several university students who also challenged the military rule. This House came to our rescue with a resolution threatening to cut aid off to the country unless all political prisoners were freed. Months later, I was put in jail again, this time in a cell with 15 men. All of them were executed a few hours later. Only the intervention of a single soldier spared me from rape. Through the grace of Almighty God and the mercy of others, I escaped and found refuge here, in Washington, D.C. But long before that, our country and I benefited from Liberia's special relationship with the United States. My family exemplifies the economic and social divide that has torn our nation. Unlike many privileged Liberians, I can claim no American lineage. Three of my grandparents were indigenous Liberians; the fourth was a German who married a rural market woman. That grandfather was forced to leave the country when Liberia, in loyalty to the United States, declared war on Germany in 1914. Both of my grandmothers were farmers and village traders. They could not read or write any language, as more than three-quarters of our people still cannot today. But they worked hard. They loved their country. They loved their families. And they believed in education. They inspired me then, and their memory motivates me to serve my people, to sacrifice for the world and honestly serve humanity. I could not, I will not, I cannot betray their trust. My parents were sent at a young age to Monrovia, where it was common for elite families to take in children from the countryside to perform domestic chores. They endured humiliation and indignities. But my mother was fortunate to be adopted by a kind woman, and both of my parents were able, through the system, to go to school, a rarity at that time for poor people. My father even became the first native Liberian in the Liberian National Legislature. I was not born with the expectation of a University education from Harvard or being a World Bank officer or an Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations. When I was a small girl in the countryside, swimming and fishing with twine made from palm trees, no one would have picked me out as the future President of our country. I graduated from the College of West Africa, a United Methodist high school. I waited tables to support my studies in the United States – college in Wisconsin and graduate school in Massachusetts. I went on to enjoy the benefits and advantages of a world-class education. So my feet are in two worlds -- the world of poor rural women with no respite from hardship, and the world of accomplished Liberian professionals, for whom the United States is a second and beloved home. I draw strength from both. But most of our people have not been as fortunate as I was. Always poor and underdeveloped, Liberia is only now emerging from two decades of turmoil that destroyed everything we managed to build in a century and a half of independence. The cost of our conflict runs wide and deep, manifested in varied ways -- mismanagement, corruption, bad governance, massive looting of public treasury and assets. Unlike the Tsunami in Asia and Hurricane Katrina here in your own country, where the destruction and human casualties were caused by nature, we participated in, or stood silently by, in our own self destruction. Our country agonized with your citizens and victims and families of these natural tragedies; and our country also agonized with itself over the effects of a senseless Civil War. In the campaign months, I traveled to every corner of our country. I trudged through mud in high boots, where roads did not exist or had a -- or had deteriorated past repair. I surveyed ruined hospitals and collapsed clinics. I held meetings by candlelight, because there was no electricity anywhere, including the capital, except from private generators. I was forced to drink water from creeks and unsanitized wells, all of which made me vulnerable to the diseases from which so many of our people die daily. I came face to face with the human devastation of war, which killed a quarter of a million of our three million people and displaced most of the rest. Hundreds of thousands escaped across borders. More could not -- fled into the bush, constantly running from one militia or another, often surviving by eating rodents and wild plants that made them sick and even killed them. Our precious children died of malaria, parasites, and malnourishments. Our boys, full of potential, were forced to be child soldiers, to kill or be killed. Our girls, capable of being anything they could imagine, were made into sex slaves, gang-raped by men with guns, made mothers while they still were children themselves. But listening to the hopes and dreams of our people, I recall the words of a Mozambican poet who said, ""Our dream has the size of freedom."" My people, like your people, believe deeply in freedom and, in their dreams, they reach for the heavens. I represent those dreams. I represent their hope and their aspirations. I ran for President because I am determined to see good governance in Liberia in my lifetime. But I also ran because I am the mother of four, and I wanted to see our children smile again. Already, I am seeing those smiles. For even after everything they have endured, the people of Liberia have faith in new beginnings. They are counting on me and my Administration to create the conditions that will guarantee the realization of their dreams. We must not betray their trust. All the children I meet -- when I ask what they want most say, ""I want to learn."" ""I want to go to school."" ""I want an education."" We must not betray their trust. Young adults -- Young adults who have been called our ""lost generation"" do not consider themselves lost. They, too, aspire to learn and to serve their families and their communities. We must not betray their trust. Women, my strong constituency, tell me that they want the same chances that men have. They want to be literate. They want their work recognized. They want protection against rape. They want clean water that won't sicken and kill their children. We must not betray their trust. Former soldiers tell me they are tired of war; they do not want to have to fight or to run again. They want training. They want jobs. If they carry guns, they want to do so in defense of peace and security, not war and pillage. We must not betray their trust. Entrepreneurs who have returned from abroad with all their resources, risking everything to invest in their country's future -- tell me they want a fair and transparent regulatory environment. They want honesty and accountability from their government. We must not betray their trust. Farming families who fled the peace -- who fled the fighting for shelter in neighboring countries or found themselves displaced from their communities want a fresh start. They want to return home. They want seeds. They want farm implements. They want roads to get their goods to market. We must not betray their trust. I have many promises to keep. As I won elections through a free -- free and peaceful process, I must preserve freedom and keep the peace. As I campaigned against corruption, I must lead a government that curbs it. As I was elected with the massive vote of women, I must assure that their needs are met. We are not oblivious to the enormity of the challenges we face. Few countries have been decimated as ours. In the chaos of war, our HIV rates have quadrupled. Our children are dying of curable diseases -- tuberculosis, dysentery, measles, malaria. Schools lack books, equipment, teachers, and buildings. The telecommunications age has passed us by. We have a 3.5 billion dollar external debt, lent in large measures to some of my predecessors who were known to be irresponsible, unaccountable, unrepresentative, and corrupt. The reality that we have lost our international creditworthiness bars us from further loans, although now we would use them wisely. Our abundant natural resources have been diverted by criminal conspiracies for private gain. International sanctions, imposed for the best of reasons, still prevent us from exporting our raw materials. Roads and bridges have disappeared or been bombed or washed away. We know that trouble could once again could breed outside our borders. The physical and spiritual scars of war are deep indeed. So with everything to be done, what must we do first? We must do everything we can to consolidate the peace that so much was paid to secure, and we must work to heal the wounds of war. We must create an emergency public works program to put the whole nation to work and give families an income through the rebuilding of critical infrastructure, strengthening security and attracting investment. We must rehabilitate the core of an electricity grid to high-priority areas and institutions, and visibly demonstrate to the people that government can provide necessary services. We must bring home more of our refugees, and resettle the displaced. We must give them the tools to start anew, and encourage most of our skilled expatriates, who have the knowledge and the experience to build our economy, to return home. For those unable to come home, we must appeal to you to grant them continuing protective status, and residency where appropriate, to put them in a condition to contribute to their country's reform and development. We must complete the demobilization of former combatants and restructure our army, police, and security services. We must create legal systems that preserve the rule of law, applied to all without fear or favor. We must revive educational facilities, including our few universities. We must provide essential agricultural extension services to help us feed ourselves again, developing the science and technology skills to insure that we prosper in a modern global economy. We must create an efficient and transparent tax system to ensure the flow of government revenues and create a hospitable investment climate. With few resources beyond the will of my people, I want you to know we have made a strong beginning. During my first few -- few weeks in office, by curbing corruption we have increased government revenue by 21 percent. We have cancelled noncompliant forestry concessions and fraudulent contracts. We have required senior government appointees to declare financial assets; implemented cash management practices to ensure fiscal discipline and sharpen efficiency; met the basic requirements for eligibility under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences and initial EXIM Bank support. We have restored good relationships with bilateral and multilateral partners; commenced the process leading to an IMF Staff Monitoring Program; accelerated implementation of the Governance and Economic Management Assistance Plan; and we've also launched a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate the abuses of war. But while we seek national unity and reconciliation, we must not sacrifice justice. I respect the life-saving role that our West African neighbors, particularly Nigeria, played at no small cost to them in accepting to host Mr. Charles Taylor. Liberians are deeply grateful. But I say here, as I have said before, Liberia has little option but to see that justice is done in accordance with the requirements of the United Nations and the broad international community. I know that my government must go beyond these strong beginnings; must do much more than we have done so far, and we must do it quickly. Our people's courage and patience are formidable, but their expectations are high. And their needs are urgent. This does not mean that we want big government. We cannot afford it, and we believe that government should not attempt to do what civil society and business can do better. The people of Liberia know that government cannot save the country; only their own strength, their determination, their creativity, resilience , and their faith can do that. But they have the right to expect the essentials that only a government can provide. They have the right to a government that is honest and respects the sanctity of human life. They need -- They need and they deserve an economic environment in which their efforts can succeed. They need infrastructure and they need security. Above all, they need peace. That is the task of my Administration. To meet that challenge, to do what is right, I ask for the continuing support of this Congress and the American people. Honorable Ladies and Gentlemen: My appeal comes with the recognition of all that you have already done. In addition to the financial assistance to disarm our fighters, to feed and house our displaced, the artful diplomacy of the United States was central to ending our long conflict. We thank you with all our hearts. As small and as impoverished as we are, we cherish the friendship we have had with you. During the Second World War, we stood together, even if only symbolically, to fight Nazi expansionism and tyranny. At the request of President Roosevelt, we planted rubber trees after the Japanese seized the Indonesian supply. When U.S. laws prohibited sending ships to a Europe at war, we agreed to establish a shipping registry to help transport American goods. During the Cold War, we hosted a submarine tracking center, an intelligence listening post, and one of the largest Voice of America transmitters in the world. Again, we ask that we continue working together; but we do not ask for patronage. We do not want to continue in dependency. The benefits of your assistance must be mutual. Honorable Members of Congress: Much is at stake for all of us. Liberia at war brought misery and crimes against humanity to its neighbors -- a toll that is beyond calculation. A peaceful, prosperous Liberia can contribute to democracy, stability, and development in West Africa and beyond. Nine times, nine times in the past 15 years, the United States has been forced to evacuate official Americans and their dependents from our country, at enormous cost to your taxpayers. Monrovia, I am told, is the most-evacuated U.S. embassy in the world. I am determined that you will not need to rescue your people from our shores for a tenth time. You contribute hundreds of millions of dollars to a UN Peacekeeping Force in Liberia. A fraction of this will be required to support a peaceful and stable Liberia. Honorable Members of this great Congress: Think with me about this. What is the return on an investment that trains young combatants for life, rather than death? What is the yield when our young men can exchange their guns for jobs? What is the savings in food aid when our people can feed themselves again? What is the profit from educating our girls to be scientists and doctors? What is the dividend when our dependence ends, and we become true partners rather than supplicants? Honorable Members: We know that there is no quick fix for the reconstruction of our country, but Liberians, young and old, share their government's commitment to work, to be honest, to unite, to reconcile, and to build. A nation so well-endowed, so blessed by God with natural resources, should not be poor starting from a small base. We have rubber and timber and diamonds and gold and iron ore. Our fields are fertile. Our water supply is plentiful. Our sunshine is warm and welcoming. With your prayers and with your help, we will demonstrate that democracy can work, even under the most challenging conditions. We will honor the suffering of our people, and Liberia will become a brilliant beacon, an example to Africa and the world of what the love of liberty can achieve. We will strive to be America's success story in Africa: demonstrating the potential in the transformation from war to peace; demonstrating the will to join in the global fight against terrorism; demonstrating that democracy can prevail; demonstrating that prosperity can be achieved. The people of Liberia have already rolled up their sleeves, despite overwhelming obstacles -- confident that their work will be rewarded, confident in the hope and promise of the future. The women of Liberia and the women of Africa, some in the marketplaces and some in the high levels of government, have already shared their trust and their confidence in my ability to succeed, and ensure that the doors of competitive politics and professionalism will be opened even wider for them. Honorable Members: I will succeed. I will not betray their trust. I will make them proud. I will make you proud in the difference which one woman with abiding faith in God can do. God bless you.",233,201,1,Republican,55,44,1,Republican,109
Silvio Berlusconi,Republic of Italy ,325,3,2006,Prime Minister,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, distinguished members of Congress, it is an extraordinary honor to be invited to speak before you in the Capitol Building, one of the great temples of democracy.I speak in representation, in the name of a country that has a deep friendship with the United States and is bound to your country by ties which go back many centuries. Many American citizens have Italian roots. For them. The United States was for them a land of opportunity that welcomed them generously, and they contributed their intelligence and their labor to help make America great. And I am proud to see that so many Italian-American members are today members of the Congress of the greatest democracy in the world. For my generation of Italians, the United States is the beacon of liberty, the beacon of civil and economic progress. I will always be grateful to the United States for having saved my country from Fascism and Nazism at the cost of so many young American lives. I will --. I will also be grateful to the United States for defending Europe from the Soviet threat in the long decades of the Cold War.By devoting so much to this victorious struggle against Communism, the United States enabled us Europeans to employ our precious resource in the recovery and development of our economies. I will always be grateful to the United States for having helped my country to climb out of poverty and achieve growth and prosperity after the second war. Thank you (sic) to the generosity of the Marshall Plan, we remember until now this generosity.And today I am still grateful to the United States for the high price in lives you continue to pay in the fight against terrorism to assure our common security and defend human rights around the world. (Applause.) As I will never tire of repeating, when I see your flag, I do not merely see the flag of a great country. Above all, I see a symbol, a universal symbol of freedom and democracy.",233,201,1,Republican,55,44,1,Republican,109
Manmohan Singh,India ,750,7,2005,Prime Minister  ,"Mr Speaker, Mr Vice President, distinguished members of the US Congress, ladies and gentlemen. I deem it a privilege to be invited to address this Joint Session of the US Congress. I thank you for the invitation. I bring you the greetings and good wishes of the people of India. India and the United States have much in common that is very important to both countries. You are the world's oldest democracy, we are its largest. Our shared commitment to democratic values and processes has been a bond that has helped us transcend differences. We admire the creativity and enterprise of the American people, the excellence of your institutions of learning, the openness of the economy, and your ready embrace of diversity. These have attracted the brightest young minds from India, creating a bridge of understanding that transcends both distance and difference between us. In addition to the values we share as democracies, there is also a convergence in our perceptions of a rapidly transforming global environment, bringing us much closer together than at any time in the past. Globalization has made the world so inter-dependent that none of us can ignore what happens elsewhere. Peace and prosperity are more indivisible than ever before in human history. As democracies, we must work together to create a world in which democracies can flourish. This is particularly important because we are today faced with new threats such as terrorism, to which democracies are particularly vulnerable. Indian democracy has been fashioned around India's civilizational ethos which celebrates diversity. Our society today is the culmination of centuries of assimilation of diverse peoples and ethnic groups. All the major religions of the world are represented in India. We have a tremendous diversity of languages, customs and traditions. The Father of our Nation, Mahatma Gandhi , called for universal adult franchise as early as 1931, long before India became independent. Our political leadership remained true to this commitment and the Constitution we adopted after Independence enshrined democracy based on free elections and the associated principles of tolerance of dissent, freedom for political activity, protection of human rights and the Rule of Law. Our first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, addressing this very forum in 1949, acknowledged our debt to America on this score. He said that you could hear in our Constitution the echo of the great voices of the Founding Fathers of your Republic. Ladies and Gentlemen. The real test of a democracy is not in what is said in the Constitution, but in how it functions on the ground. All Indians can be proud of what we have achieved in this area and our experience is also relevant beyond our boundaries. Free and fair elections are the foundation of a democracy. Over the past six decades, governments in India, at both the national and state level, have regularly sought the mandate of the people through elections. Our elections are conducted under the supervision of a statutory independent Election Commission, which has earned respect for its fairness and transparency, both at home and abroad. The independent judiciary has been a zealous defender of our Constitution and a credible guarantor of the Rule of Law. The Press is a key institution in any democracy and our media has a well-earned reputation for being free and fearless. Our minorities, and we have many, participate actively in all walks of national life -- political, commercial and cultural. Civil society organizations are thriving and are vigilant in protecting human rights. They are also watchful of threats to the environment. Our Army has remained a professional force, subject throughout to civilian control. Recently, the Constitution was amended to ensure constitutionally mandated elections to village and municipal councils. This process has produced no less than three million elected representatives in the country, with one million positions reserved for women. This has brought democracy closer to the people and also empowered women and promoted gender balance. Our commitment to democratic values and practices means there are many concerns and perceptions that we share with the United States. The most important common concern is the threat of terrorism. Democracy can only thrive in open and free societies. But open societies like ours are today threatened more than ever before by the rise of terrorism. The very openness of our societies makes us more vulnerable, and yet we must deal effectively with the threat without losing the openness we so value and cherish. India and the United States have both suffered grievously from terrorism and we must make common cause against it. We know that those who resort to terror often clothe it in the garb of real or imaginary grievances. We must categorically affirm that no grievance can justify resort to terror. Democracies provide legitimate means for expressing dissent. They provide the right to engage in political activity, and must continue to do so. However, for this very reason, they cannot afford to be soft on terror. Terrorism exploits the freedom our open societies provide to destroy our freedoms. The United States and India must work together in all possible forums to counter all forms of terrorism. We cannot be selective in this area. We must fight terrorism wherever it exists, because terrorism anywhere threatens democracy everywhere. We know from experience that democratic societies which guarantee individual freedom and tolerance of dissent provide an environment most conducive to creative endeavor, and the establishment of socially just societies. We therefore have an obligation to help other countries that aspire for the fruits of democracy. Just as developed industrial countries assist those that are less developed to accelerate development, democratic societies with established institutions must help those that want to strengthen democratic values and institutions. In this spirit, President Bush and I agreed yesterday on a global initiative to help build democratic capacities in all societies that seek such assistance. The capacities we have in mind are those related to the electoral, parliamentary, judicial and human rights processes of emerging democracies. Respect for cultural diversity, minority rights and gender equality is an important goal of this initiative. Democracy is one part of our national endeavor. Development is the other. Openness will not gain popular support if an open society is not a prosperous society. This is especially so in developing countries, where a large number of people have legitimate material expectations which must be met. That is why we must transform India's economy, to raise the standard of living of all our people and in the process eliminate poverty. India's aspirations in the respect are not different from those of other developing countries. But we are unique in one respect. There is no other country of a billion people, with our tremendous cultural, linguistic and religious diversity, that has tried to modernize its society and transform its economy within the framework of a functioning democracy. To attempt this at our modest levels of per capita income is a major challenge. We are determined to succeed in this effort. To achieve our developmental goals, our policies and strategies must be in step with changed circumstances and especially the opportunities now available in the global economy. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, standing at this very podium two decades ago, spoke of the challenge of building anew on old foundations. He started a process of reorienting India's economic policies, which has been continued by successive governments. The economic policy changes that have been made in India have far-reaching implications. They have liberated Indian enterprise from government control and made the economy much more open to global flows of trade, capital and technology. Our entrepreneurial talent has been unleashed, and is encouraged to compete with the best. We will continue this process so that Indian talent and enterprise can realize its full potential, enabling India to participate in the global economy as an equal partner. We are often criticized for being too slow in making changes in policy, but democracy means having to build a consensus in favor of change. As elected representatives, you are all familiar with this problem. We have to assuage the doubts and calm the fears that often arise when people face the impact of change. Many of the fears we have to address are exaggerated, but they must be addressed. This is necessary to ensure sustainability. India's economic reforms must be seen in this light: they may appear slow, but I assure you they are durable and irreversible. I am happy to say that our efforts at transforming India into an economy more integrated with the world have borne fruit. Our rate of growth of GDP has increased steadily, and has averaged around 6.0 per cent per year over the past two decades. Poverty has declined although more slowly than we would like. We are determined to improve on this performance. We hope to raise our growth rate to 8 per cent or so over the next two years, and we will ensure that this growth is ""inclusive"" so that its benefits are widely spread. For this we must act on several fronts. We must do much more in health and education, which are crucial for human development. We must continue to open up our economy. We must impart a new impetus to agricultural development. We must expand investment in economic infrastructure which is a critical constraint on our growth prospects. India's growth and prosperity is in American interest. American investments in India, especially in new technology areas, will help American companies to reduce costs and become more competitive globally. Equally, India's earnings from these investments will lead to increased purchases from the United States. The information technology revolution in India is built primarily on US computer related technology and hardware. There are many other examples of such two-way benefits, with both sides gaining from the process. US firms are already leading the foreign investment drive in India. I believe 400 of the Fortune 500 are already in India. They produce for the Indian market and will hopefully also source supplies from India for their global supply chains. We welcome this involvement and look forward to further expansion in the years ahead. India needs massive foreign direct investment, especially in infrastructure. I hope American companies will participate in the opportunities we are creating. The 21st century will be driven by knowledge-based production and India is well placed in this area. We have a large and relatively young population with a social tradition that values higher education. Our educated young people are also English-speaking. This makes us potentially an attractive location for production of high-end services whether in software, engineering design or research in pharmaceutical and other areas. Our laws on intellectual property rights have been recently amended to comply fully with our international obligations under the WTO. We look forward to attracting business in these areas from the United States. The presence of a large number of Indian Americans in high technology industries here makes the US and India natural partners. It gives you confidence about India's human resource capability. It also gives you an edge over your competitors in the ease with which you can operate in India. We are proud of what the Indian American community have done in this country. I was touched, as were many of my countrymen, by the news that a Resolution of this House celebrated the contribution of Indian Americans to research, innovation, and promotion of trade and international cooperation between India and the US. Ladies and gentlemen To fully exploit potential areas for cooperation between our two countries, we need to make special efforts to bring our private sectors closer together. To this end, President Bush and I have constituted an India-US forum of chief executive officers. I hope this forum will promote greater understanding of each other's perspectives and also a better assessment of prospects for future cooperation. The two governments will draw on their experience and advice on how to realise the full potential of our relationship. The bulk of our population still depends upon agriculture for a living. The United States was an early partner in this area, helping to establish agricultural universities and research institutions in India in the 1960s. It was an American, Nobel Laureate Norman Borlaug, supported by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, who developed high yielding varieties of wheat in Mexico which were then adapted to Indian conditions in the Agricultural Universities you helped establish. This was the start of the Green Revolution in India that lifted countless millions above poverty. I am very happy to say that President Bush and I have decided to launch a second generation of India-US collaboration in agriculture. The new initiative will focus on basic and strategic research for sustainable development of agriculture to meet the challenge of raising productivity in conditions of water stress. It seeks to take information and knowhow directly to the farming community and promote technologies that minimise post harvest wastage and improve food storage. It will also help Indian farmers to meet phyto-sanitary conditions and enable them to participate more fully in global agricultural trade. Energy security is another area where our two countries have strong common interests. The world's reserves of hydrocarbons are finite and we must tap new energy sources. India's reliance on coal and hydro-power will increase. We have to invest in new oil and gas exploration and in enhanced recovery of oil and gas from available fields. We must also tap the full potential of nuclear energy. The US can help in all these areas. I am happy to say we have initiated an Energy Dialogue with the US to explore the scope for cooperation in each of these areas in the years ahead. The field of civil nuclear energy is a vital area for cooperation between our two countries. As a consequence of our collective efforts, our relationship in this sector is being transformed. President Bush and I arrived at an understanding in finding ways and means to enable such cooperation. In this context, I would also like to reiterate that India's track record in nuclear non-proliferation is impeccable. We have adhered scrupulously to every rule and canon in this area. We have done so even though we have witnessed unchecked nuclear proliferation in our own neighbourhood which has directly affected our security interests. This is because India, as a responsible nuclear power, is fully conscious of the immense responsibilities that come with the possession of advanced technologies, both civilian and strategic. We have never been, and will never be, a source of proliferation of sensitive technologies. We are conscious that plans to meet our energy requirements will have implications for the environment. This is especially so since any energy scenario for India will involve heavy dependence on coal. Clean coal technologies that can make an impact need to be developed and should be affordable for poorer countries. We need to find ways whereby sufficient resources can be devoted to ensure the development of these technologies. We must also find ways of allowing greater access for developing countries to these technologies including ways of undertaking cooperative research. We stand ready to explore new partnerships in this area with you, which will help enable a more efficient use of our hydrocarbon resources. There are other areas too where we can collaborate. Our combined effort in providing relief and succor to the millions affected by last December's tsunami is an example of what partnership can achieve. Building on this experience, President Bush and I have launched a joint initiative to ensure that our capabilities will be readily on call for those in need in similar situations in future. The global challenge of HIV/AIDS is another area for India-US cooperation. President Bush and I have agreed on the need to provide increased international access to safe and effective anti-retroviral drugs. Ladies and gentlemen. Globalization has woven a web of inter-connections across the world. This makes it all the more necessary that we evolve a system of global governance that carries credibility and commands legitimacy. Such a system must be sufficiently participative to be able to generate a global consensus. It must also reflect contemporary reality. The Doha round of world trade negotiations and the reform of the United Nations are two major processes in the international arena where we need to work together to strengthen the system of global governance. India is committed to strengthening the multilateral trading system and we will work with the US and other partners for a successful outcome of the Doha Round. I am sure that we can find a reasonable and balanced outcome that is mutually beneficial. We will make every effort to do so. On the reform of the United Nations, we believe that it is time to recognize the enormous changes that have occurred since the present structure was established. There must be comprehensive reform of the United Nations to make it more effective and also more representative. The UN Security Council must be restructured as part of the reform process. In this context, you would agree that the voice of the world's largest democracy surely cannot be left unheard on the Security Council when the United Nations is being restructured. Mr Speaker, Mr Vice President, distinguished senators and members of the House of Representatives, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to conclude by saying that the Indian people look forward to a bright future, full of confidence, based on a growing recognition of our economic capabilities and the readiness of our society to meet the challenges before us. We have had some success in improving the quality of life of our own people and we will redouble our efforts to this end. We will also work towards securing a world order in which democracy can flourish, and in which developing nations can strive for greater prosperity. As two democracies, we are natural partners in many respects. Partnerships can be of two kinds. There are partnerships based on principle and there are partnerships based on pragmatism. I believe we are at a juncture where we can embark on a partnership that can draw both on principle as well as pragmatism. We must build on this opportunity. My objective on this visit was to lay the basis for transformed ties between our two great countries. I believe that we have made a very good beginning. With the support and understanding of the Congress, the full benefits of our partnership will be realised in the months and years to come. India is today embarked on a journey inspired by many dreams. We welcome having America by our side. There is much we can accomplish together. Thank you",233,201,1,Republican,55,44,1,Republican,109
Viktor Yushchenko,Ukraine ,369,4,2005,President ,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, honorable senators and House members, ladies and gentlemen. On the wall of this great building there is a Latin phrase that means ""out of many, one."" This motto reminds the world about the American Revolution, the starting point of the modern world's history of liberty. My road here went through the orange-colored Independence Square that became known as Maidan. Millions of people standing there continuously repeated, ""Together we are many. We cannot be defeated."" This motto of the Ukrainian Revolution is a reminder of the fact that freedom continues to win. Ukraine is opening a new page in the world's chronicle of liberty in the 21st century. These two mottos have a lot in common. They speak to the strength of our peoples that comes from unity. They speak of the victories of our peoples and their struggles for freedom. For me, the invitation to speak before a Joint Session of Congress is an expression of respect for my Ukrainian nation. I am deeply honored to speak from the rostrum where before me stood so many great leaders -- Winston Churchill, Lech Walesa, Nelson Mandela. I am grateful for the unique opportunity to address this great forum of the American people. I perceive your eagerness to hear the new Ukraine as a token of partnership of the two nations united by shared democratic values. On behalf of the Ukrainian people, I'd like to thank the United States Congress, U.S. Presidents George Walker Bush, Bill Clinton, George Bush, and the entire American nation for their invariable respect for Ukraine and their support for the Ukraine's democracy. I would like to pay special tribute to President Ronald Reagan. He's well-remembered in Ukraine for his deep commitment to the freedom of Ukraine.  It is of special significance for me to express our gratitude right in this room. It is here that the Ukrainian nation enjoyed support at the hardest times of its history. It is here where the rights of enslaved nations were advocated. It is from this hall where the world came to know about the truth about the Holodomor, the genocide-famine masterminded to annihilate millions of Ukrainians. It is in this hall that freedom for Ukraine was voiced at the time when the nation was deprived of its own voice. Your words reached us and gave us hope. We heard them, because at all times, Ukrainians felt related to Americans in the space of freedom. In this space of freedom, no Iron Curtain could divide us.  In your city there is a monument to the father of the Ukrainian nation, the great poet Taras Shevchenko, whose prophecy of the emergence of Ukraine -- of its own Washington with a new and righteous law is enshrined on its pedestal. These verses have a profound and special meaning for all Ukrainians. Shevchenko was inspired by the invincible power of the words that God has bestowed each man on earth with the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This shared conviction determines the unity of Americans and Ukrainians, and no distances can obstruct it.  The American example of freedom has always been luring. Other regimes that sought to suppress democracy in Ukraine would often endeavor to nurture anti-American phobias. But they would invariably fail. Efforts of our American friends, who in the past so generously shared their democratic experience with us, enhanced the partnership between our two nations. For me, gratitude for these efforts has a personal dimension. It was through one of these programs that I met my wife, Kateryna Chumachenko Yushchenko, whose love and commitment gave me the strength to withstand the trials of the last months and years. I want to use this special opportunity to thank her for being beside me even at the most dangerous, lethal threat, I would say. Also, I want to thank the United States for helping my wife, like millions of Ukrainians brought here by waves of immigration, to learn the values of freedom, even still live with Ukraine in her heart. Many noble men and women on both sides of the Atlantic have always believed in Ukraine's democratic future. Our common belief came true in the days of the Orange Revolution. We highly appreciate the message sent by your country's leadership before the elections and during the Orange Revolution. It was clear and unambiguous. The U.S. condemned fraud and upheld Ukraine's right to freely elect their government.  This message enhanced our partnership even stronger in the name of democracy. The Orange Revolution gave evidence that Ukraine is an advanced European nation, sharing the great values of the Euro- Atlantic civilization. A civil society has matured in Ukraine. Its citizens stand ready to guard their rights and freedoms. We Ukrainians are a diverse nation. We speak different languages, we practice different religions, and we have different political views. But we all recognize the right of each and every individual to determine his or her fate. This recognition underlies our unity and our strength. In the days of revolution, millions of people went out to the Maidan and not a single act of violence -- and I repeat, not a single act of violence -- was recorded there.  Under orange banners, the people shared bread and warmth not only with friends, but with their opponents as well. Armed with belief and convictions, the people overthrew a corrupt regime. The dirtiest election campaign in history ended with gracious victory of justice. Citizens of Ukraine bowed down to the authority of justice and have jointly assumed the responsibility for their own fate. Ladies and gentlemen, today Ukraine is looking into the future with great hope and expectation. The free and fair elections have brought to state offices a new generation of politicians not encumbered with the mentality of the Soviet past. These are honest and professional patriots. We are working as one team in pursuit of one goal: to lead our nation to success in the shortest time possible. We're shaping a new model of government, new model of behavior of our government. It must safeguard the constitutional rights and freedoms of citizens. We want a government of the people, by the people and for the people.  The new power will not permit any administrative pressure upon the next year's parliamentary elections. Their fairness and transparency will be secured. The people themselves will not allow it any other way. The first indicator of changes is the ever-growing independence of mass media. We have freed the press from pressures. There are no more instructions on what may and what may not be covered. The monopoly of media by two or three oligarchic clans will be halted. We are building a free society committed to freedom of speech, and we stand ready to defend it.  For me, each case of a journalist's death is a challenge to democracy. We wish to discover the truth about all tragedies that have occurred in the past years. Important evidence in the investigation of Georgiy Gongadze's assassination case has been already obtained. Not only the perpetrators, but those who contracted those crimes will be held responsible.  Everybody who was killing politicians and journalists will stand the trial, everybody who led the country to the split-up. We have a political will to return to Ukrainians the faith and belief in justice. Our top priority task is to secure independence of judiciary.  Our goal is to instill in Ukraine the rule of law. We're building a society where there will be no room for intolerance. My father, Andre Yushchenko, the prisoner of Auschwitz, Buchenwald and Dachau. As a child I heard my father's stories about the hell of concentration camps. I am a son of a nation that survived the most terrible tragedies of the 20th century; the Holodomor famine, that took away 20 million lives of Ukrainians, and the Holocaust. The 60th anniversary of the allied victory over Naziism once again calls upon us to fulfill our obligation to root out any expressions of anti-Semitism and xenophobia, to secure minority rights and liberties. I stand ready to fulfill those duties. All citizens of Ukraine, whether they be Ukrainians, Russians, Jewish or anybody else, will live in the society with open opportunities for everyone. My oath is built in the reminiscences of the common prayer of hundreds of thousands of people in the Maidan. Christians, Jews, Moslems were praying in one prayer, everybody according to their rights, that everybody were requesting the creator one thing: freedom, fairness and blessing for Ukraine and for each of its citizens.  We're building an open economy that encourages innovation, rewards initiative and ensures high social standards. We are beginning an implacable war on corruption, promoting fair competition and forming transparent government-to-business relations. My goal is to place Ukraine in the forefront of prosperous democracies. My vision of the future is Ukraine in a united Europe.  We view accession to the European Union as an opportunity to realize the potential of our country. For us, a European future is a powerful incentive to attain high political, social and economic standards. We have observed the openness of European doors, adding to our neighbors' confidence. It would be unfair to deprive Ukrainians of these opportunities -- Ukrainians, who so (courageously/graciously ?) proved their European identity -- of this chance.  Ukraine wishes to guarantee security to its citizens, to live in peace and accord with all of its neighbors, whether in the East or in the West. It is only logical that we target our efforts towards the integration to NATO, the alliance that plays an essential role in securing peace and stability across the European continent.  I'm convinced that the European and Euro-Atlantic aspirations of Ukraine may not be viewed as an additional hindrance. Ukraine's integration is not a problem but rather great new opportunities opening before our civilization. Ukraine's accession to the European Union will put an end to the division of Europe and provide a new impetus to our civilization. Ukraine's accession to the alliance means a new level of stability across a strategically vital region stretching from Warsaw to Tbilisi and to Baku. It is quite natural for me to dwell upon new opportunities while standing at this podium. The United States, like no other country, has always built its policies on the premises of freedom, instead of merely seeking to retain a balance of power and interests. Since the times of President Wilson, this great idealism inspired Europeans, lending them strength and courage for historic changes. President Reagan advocated these ideals of freedom when he -- in front of the Berlin Wall he challenged President Gorbachev, ""Tear down this wall, Mr. President.""  President Bush realized these ideals when he upheld the unification of Germany. President Clinton reminded of these ideals when he supported the accession to NATO of East European and Baltic countries. I deeply believe that America is again ready for such historic decisions. I have no doubt that we will receive support to our efforts and our aspirations. We do not want any more walls dividing Europe, and I'm certain that neither do you.  Dear friends, the goal of my visit to the U.S. is to establish a new era in Ukraine-U.S. relations. We do not seek only thaws that alter chillings in our relations, we seek a new atmosphere of trust, frankness and partnership. A new Ukraine offers the U.S. genuinely strategic partnership. My discussions with President Bush have made it clear that Ukraine is being understood and supported. The time has come to make real steps towards each other. Step one, dear friends, we want to bury the Cold War relics of the senators and House members. I'm calling upon you to waive Jackson-Vanik amendment.  Make this step. Please make this step towards Ukraine. Please tear down this wall. Step two. The new Ukrainian government has, on an unprecedented scale, opened Ukrainian market, dramatically reducing customs restrictions. In return, we expect the United States to cancel the restrictions that apply to Ukrainian goods in the U.S. market. I'm calling upon you, ladies and gentlemen, please make this step. Step three, the non-recognition of the market-based economy status for Ukraine is an anachronism. Ukrainian producers are deprived of the rights enjoyed by their competitors. The time has come to restore fairness. Three days ago, Ukraine has officially requested the U.S. government to grant market-based economy to Ukraine, and we are requesting that you make it happen by the fall.  Step four, by November of this year, Ukraine must become a WTO member. I would encourage you in the nearest months, please support our WTO accession.  Step five, we invite the United States to, during this year, involve all political, financial and technological resources to erect a new shelter over the destroyed reactor of Chernobyl power plant. I would ask the Congress to support relevant programs.  Step six, we want to see up to two (sic) Ukrainian students learning in the U.S. universities over the next five years. I would encourage the Congress to finance such educational programs for Ukrainian students.  Step seven, Ukraine has agreed to waive visa regime for the United States citizens.  I would request the U.S. government to, in the speediest possible manner, make a reciprocal step in relation to Ukrainian students, politicians and business people. Step eight, on behalf of Ukraine, I would ask you to include it in the list of participants of the Millennium Challenge program. Following these priorities, we can make many others happen. For this, we have necessary possibilities in different areas. We welcome investments into Ukraine's economy, and are committed to creating a most favorable climate for the U.S. and all other international investors. It is in our own mutual interest to achieve as many success stories as possible of American enterprise in Ukraine. The U.S and Ukraine have common strategic interests, and we have unity in one thing: everywhere where possible, we want to uphold freedom and democracy. We are prepared for such a responsibility because we know if somebody is deprived of freedom, this freedom has been taken away from us. Eleven years ago, my country voluntarily gave up the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal. Ukraine made the world a safer place to live. Time has shown that this decision has not always met the kind of appreciation it deserved. Nonetheless, we remain committed to jointly counter the threats posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, missile and nuclear technologies. Ukraine will be a reliable partner to the U.S. in fighting terrorism. I'm sure we will be able to overcome it, and not only by power of force; it is our obligation to eradicate the sources of terrorism. We can defeat the ideology that nourishes it, the ideology of hatred. I'm fully convinced that the time will come when in the dictionary of world languages, the term ""terrorism"" will be followed by the footnote: ""archaic term."" The same footnote, I'm sure, will also accompany other shameful phenomena like racism, discrimination and slavery. We are witnessing the first successes of freedom in Iraq, where Ukrainian soldiers are risking their lives shoulder to shoulder with the American counterparts. Ukraine is eager to continue its support to a democratically elected Iraqi government in addressing its economic and security challenges. The array of subjects for our dialogue is endless, but I would prefer to see the leading role played not by governmental but by public diplomacy. Before my departure for the U.S., I received a letter from a group of respectable Ukrainian and American civic organizations proposing concrete and relevant subjects for expanding our dialogue. These initiatives, I'm sure, are worthy of being supported. Ladies and gentlemen, John Fitzgerald Kennedy took an oath before the whole world by saying we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of liberty. I am subscribing to these words on behalf of Ukraine. This authority was given to me by my fellow countrymen, who endured days and nights in bitter cold and snow of the Maidan. Ukraine is free and will always remain free. Citizens of Ukraine gained their freedom due to their courage and support of friends and proponents of democracy throughout the world. In these days I want to recall one of them, Pope John Paul II, who said, ""Following the path of truth is sometimes difficult, but never impossible."" We have embarked upon this road and will never step away from it. Together we are many. Together we are not defeated. God bless America. God protect Ukraine. Thank You.",233,201,1,Republican,55,44,1,Republican,109
Ayad Allaw,Republic of Iraq ,645,10,2004,Prime Minister ,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, it's my distinct honor and great privilege to speak to you today on behalf of Iraq's interim government and its people. It's my honor to come to Congress and to thank this nation and its people for making our cause your cause, our struggle your struggle. Before I turn to my government's plan for Iraq, I have three important messages for you today. First, we are succeeding in Iraq. It's a tough struggle with setbacks, but we are succeeding. I have seen some of the images that are being shown here on television. They are disturbing. They focus on the tragedies, such as the brutal and barbaric murder of two American hostages this week. We Iraqis are grateful to you, America, for your leadership and your sacrifice for our liberation and our opportunity to start anew. Third, I stand here today as the prime minister of a country emerging finally from dark ages of violence, aggression, corruption and greed. Like almost every Iraqi, I have many friends who were murdered, tortured or raped by the regime of Saddam Hussein. Well over a million Iraqis were murdered or are missing. We estimate at least 300,000 in mass graves, which stands as monuments to the inhumanity of Saddam's regime. Thousands of my Kurdish brothers and sisters were gassed to death by Saddam's chemical weapons. Millions more like me were driven into exile. Even in exile, as I myself can vouch, we were not safe from Saddam. And as we lived under tyranny at home, so our neighbors lived in fear of Iraq's aggression and brutality. Reckless wars, use of weapons of mass destruction, the needless loss of hundreds of thousands of lives and the financing and exporting of terrorism, these were Saddam's legacy to the world. My friends, today we are better off, you are better off and the world is better off without Saddam Hussein. Your decision to go to war in Iraq was not an easy one but it was the right one. There are no words that can express the debt of gratitude that future generations of Iraqis will owe to Americans. It would have been easy to have turned your back on our plight, but this is not the tradition of this great country, nor for the first time in history you stood up with your allies for freedom and democracy. 'Thank you in the United States' Ladies and gentlemen, I particularly want to thank you in the United States Congress for your brave vote in 2002 to authorize American men and women to go to war to liberate my country, because you realized what was at stake. And I want to thank you for your continued commitment last year when you voted to grant Iraq a generous reconstruction and security funding package. I have met many of you last year and I have in Iraq. It's a tribute to your commitment to our country that you have come to see firsthand the challenges and the progress we have and we are making. Ladies and gentlemen, the costs now have been high. As we have lost our loved ones in this struggle, so have you. As we have mourned, so have you. This is a bitter price of combating tyranny and terror. Our hearts go to the families, every American who has given his or her life and every American who has been wounded to help us in our struggle. Now we are determined to honor your confidence and sacrifice by putting into practice in Iraq the values of liberty and democracy, which are so dear to you and which have triumphed over tyranny across our world. Creating a democratic, prosperous and stable nation, where differences are respected, human rights protected, and which lives in peace with itself and its neighbor, is our highest priority, our sternest challenge and our greatest goal. It is a vision, I assure you, shared by the vast majority of the Iraqi people. But there are the tiny minority who despise the very ideas of liberty, of peace, of tolerance, and who will kill anyone, destroy anything, to prevent Iraq and its people from achieving this goal. Among them are those who nurse fantasies of the former regime returning to power. There are fanatics who seek to impose a perverted vision of Islam in which the face of Allah cannot be seen. And there are terrorists, including many from outside Iraq, who seek to make our country the main battleground against freedom, democracy and civilization. For the struggle in Iraq today is not about the future of Iraq only. It's about the worldwide war between those who want to live in peace and freedom, and terrorists. Terrorists strike indiscriminately at soldiers, at civilians, as they did so tragically on 9/11 in America, and as they did in Spain and Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Russia in my country and many others. So in Iraq we confront both, insurgency and the global war on terror with their destructive forces sometimes overlapping. These killers may be just a tiny fraction of our 27 million population, but with their guns and their suicide bombs to intimidate and to frighten all the people of Iraq, I can tell you today, they will not succeed. For these murderers have no political program or cause other than push our country back into tyranny. Their agenda is no different than terrorist forces that have struck all over the world, including your own country on September 11th. There lies the fatal weakness: The insurgency in Iraq is destructive but small and it has not and will never resonate with the Iraqi people. The Iraqi citizens know better than anyone the horrors of dictatorship. This is past we will never revisit. Ladies and gentlemen, let me turn now to our plan which we have developed to meet the real challenges which Iraq faces today, a plan that we are successfully implementing with your help. The plan has three basic parts: building democracy, defeating the insurgency and improving the quality of ordinary Iraqis. The political strategy in our plan is to isolate the terrorists from the communities in which they operate. We are working hard to involve as many people as we can in the political process to cut the ground from under the terrorists' feet. In troubled areas across the country, government representatives are meeting with local leaders. They are offering amnesty to those who realize the error of their ways. They are making clear that there can be no compromise with terror, that all Iraqis have the opportunity to join the side of order and democracy, and that they should use the political process to address their legitimate concerns and hopes. I am a realist. I know that terrorism cannot be defeated with political tools only. But we can weaken it, ending local support, help us to tackle the enemy head-on, to identify, isolate and eradicate this cancer. Let me provide you with a couple of examples of where this political plan already is working. In Samarra, the Iraqi government has tackled the insurgents who once controlled the city. Following weeks of discussions between government officials and representatives, coalition forces and local community leaders, regular access to the city has been restored. A new provincial council and governor have been selected, and a new chief of police has been appointed. Hundreds of insurgents have been pushed out of the city by local citizens, eager to get with their lives. Today in Samarra, Iraqi forces are patrolling the city, in close coordination with their coalition counterparts. In Talafa, a city northwest of Baghdad, the Iraqi government has reversed an effort by insurgents to arrest, control (inaudible) the proper authorities. Iraqi forces put down the challenge and allowed local citizens to choose a new mayor and police chief. Thousands of civilians have returned to the city. And since their return, we have launched a large program of reconstruction and humanitarian assistance. Ladies and gentlemen, let me turn now to our military strategy. We plan to build and maintain security forces across Iraq. Ordinary Iraqis are anxious to take over entirely this role and to shoulder all the security burdens of our country as quickly as possible. For now, of course, we need the help of our American and coalition partners. But the training of Iraqi security forces is moving forward briskly and effectively. The Iraqi government now commands almost 50,000 armed and combat- ready Iraqis. By January it will be some 145,000. And by the end of next year, some 250,000 Iraqis. The government has accelerated the development of Iraqi special forces, and the establishment of a counter-terrorist strike force to tackle specific problems caused by insurgencies. Our intelligence is getting better every day. You have seen that the successful resolution of the Najaf crisis, and then the targeted attacks against insurgents in Falluja. These new Iraqi forces are rising to the challenge. They are fighting on behalf of sovereign Iraqi government, and therefore their performance is improving every day. Working closely with the coalition allies, they are striking their enemies wherever they hide, disrupting operations, destroying safe houses and removing terrorist leaders. But improving the everyday lives of Iraqis, tackling our economic problems is also essential to our plan. Across the country there is a daily progress, too. Oil pipelines are being repaired. Basic services are being improved. The homes are being rebuilt. Schools and hospitals are being rebuilt. The clinics are open and reopened. There are now over 6 million children at school, many of them attending one of the 2,500 schools that have been renovated since liberation. Last week, we completed a national polio vaccination campaign, reaching over 90 percent of all Iraqi children. We're starting work on 150 new health centers across the country. Millions of dollars in economic aid and humanitarian assistance from this country and others around the world are flowing into Iraq. For this, again, I want to thank you. And so today, despite the setbacks and daily outrages, we can and should be hopeful for the future. In Najaf and Kufa, this plan has already brought success. In those cities a firebrand cleric had taken over Shia Islam's holiest sites in defiance of the government and the local population. Immediately, the Iraqi government ordered the Iraqi armed forces into action to use military force to create conditions for political success. Together with the coalition partners, Iraqi forces cleaned out insurgents from everywhere in the city, capturing hundreds and killing many more. At the same time, the government worked with political leaders and with Ayatollah Sistani to find a peaceful solution to the occupation of the shrine. We were successful. The shrine was preserved. Order was restored. And Najaf and Kufa were returned to their citizens.Today the foreign media have lost interest and left, but millions of dollars in economic aid and humanitarian assistance are now flowing into the cities. Ordinary citizens are once again free to live and worship at these places. As we move forward, the next major milestone will be holding of the free and fair national and local elections in January next. I know that some have speculated, even doubted, whether this date can be met. So let me be absolutely clear: Elections will occur in Iraq on time in January because Iraqis want elections on time. For the skeptics who do not understand the Iraqi people, they do not realize how decades of torture and repression feed our desire for freedom. At every step of the political process to date the courage and resilience of the Iraqi people has proved the doubters wrong. They said we would miss January deadline to pass the interim constitution. We proved them wrong. They warned that there could be no successful handover of sovereignty by the end of June. We proved them wrong. A sovereign Iraqi government took over control two days early. They doubted whether a national conference could be staged this August. We proved them wrong. Despite intimidation and violence, over 1,400 citizens, a quarter of them women, from all regions and from every ethnic, religious and political grouping in Iraq, elected a national council. And I pledge to you today, we'll prove them wrong again over the elections. Our independent electoral commission is working with the United Nations, the multinational force and our own Iraqi security forces to make these elections a reality. In 15 out of our 18 Iraqi provinces we could hold elections tomorrow. Although this is not what we see in your media, it is a fact. Your government, our government and the United Nations are all helping us mobilizing the necessary resources to fund voter registration and information programs. We will establish up to 30,000 polling sites, 130,000 election workers, and all other complex aspects mounting a general election in a nation of 27 million before the end of January next. We already know that terrorists and former regime elements will do all they can to disrupt these elections. There would be no greater success for the terrorists if we delay and no greater blow when the elections take place, as they will, on schedule. The Iraqi elections may not be perfect, may not be the best elections that Iraq will ever hold. They will no doubt be an excuse for violence from those that despise liberty, as were the first elections in Sierra Leone, South Africa or Indonesia. But they will take place, and they will be free and fair. And though they won't be the end of the journey toward democracy, they will be a giant step forward in Iraq's political evolution. They will pave the way for a government that reflects the world, and has the confidence of the Iraqi people. Ladies and gentlemen, this is our strategy for moving Iraq steadily toward the security and democracy and prosperity our people crave. But Iraq cannot accomplish this alone. The resolve and will of the coalition in supporting a free Iraq is vital to our success. The Iraqi government needs the help of the international community, the help of countries that not only believe in the Iraqi people but also believe in the fight for freedom and against tyranny and terrorism everywhere. Already, Iraq has many partners. The transition in Iraq from brutal dictatorship to freedom and democracy is not only an Iraqi endeavor, it is an international one. More than 30 countries are represented in Iraq with troops on the ground in harm's way. We Iraqis are grateful for each and every one of these courageous men and women. United Nations Resolution 1546 passed in June 2004, endorsed the Iraqi interim government and pledged international support for Iraq upcoming elections. The G-8, the European Union and NATO have also issued formal statements of support. NATO is now helping with one of Iraq's most urgent needs, the training of Iraqi security forces. I am delighted by the new agreement to step up the pace and scope of this training. The United Nations has reestablished its mission in Iraq, a new United Nations special representative has been appointed and a team of United Nations personnel is now operating in Baghdad. Many more nations have committed to Iraq's future in the form of economic aid. We Iraqis are aware how international this effort truly is. But our opponents, the terrorists, also understand all too well that this is an international effort. And that's why they have targeted members of the coalition. I know the pain this causes. I know it is difficult but the coalition must stand firm. When governments negotiate with terrorists, everyone in the free world suffers. When political leaders sound the siren of defeatism in the face of terrorism, it only encourage more violence. Working together, we will defeat the killers, and we will do this by refusing to bargain about our most fundamental principles. Ladies and gentlemen, good will aside, I know that many observers around the world honestly wonder if we in Iraq really can restore our economy, be good neighbors, guarantee the democratic rule of law and overcome the enemies who seek to tear us down. I understand why, faced with the daily headlines, there are these doubts. I know, too, that there will be many more setbacks and obstacles to overcome. But these doubters risk underestimating our country and they risk fueling the hopes of the terrorists. Despite our problems, despite our recent history, no one should doubt that Iraq is a country of tremendous human resources and national resources. Iraq is still a nation with an inspiring culture and the tradition and an educated and civilized people. And Iraq is still a land made strong by a faith which teaches us tolerance, love, respect and duty. Above all, they risk underestimating the courage, determination of the Iraqi people to embrace democracy, peace and freedom, for the dreams of our families are the same as the dreams of the families here in America and around the world. There are those who want to divide our world. I appeal to you, who have done so much already to help us, to ensure they don't succeed. Do not allow them to say to Iraqis, to Arabs, to Muslims, that we have only two models of governments, brutal dictatorship and religious extremism. This is wrong. Like Americans, we Iraqis want to enjoy the fruits of liberty. Half of the world's 1.5 billion Muslims already enjoy democratically elected governments. As Prime Minister Blair said to you last year when he stood here, anywhere, any time ordinary people are given the chance to choose, the choice is the same: freedom not tyranny, democracy not dictatorship, and the rule of law not the rule of the secret police. Do not let them convince others that the values of freedom, of tolerance and democracy are for you in the West but not for us. For the first time in our history, the Iraqi people can look forward to controlling our own destiny. This would not have been possible without the help and sacrifices of this country and its coalition partners. I thank you again from the bottom of my heart. And let me tell you that as we meet our greatest challenge by building a democratic future, we the people of the new Iraq will remember those who have stood by us. As generous as you have been, we will stand with you, too. As stalwart as you have been, we will stand with you, too. Neither tyranny nor terrorism has a place in our region or our world. And that is why we Iraqis will stand by you, America, in a war larger than either of our nations, the global battle to live in freedom. God bless you and thank you",229,205,1,Republican,51,48,1,Republican,108
Hamid Karzai,Transitional Islamic State of Afganistan ,700,6,2004,President,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, the great people of the United States of America, it is my distinct honor to speak on behalf of the Afghan people in this august assembly. I thank you and the people of this great country for your generosity and commitment to our people. You have supported us with your resources, with your leadership in the world community, and most importantly with the precious lives of your soldiers. With your support, Afghanistan has accomplished a number of significant achievements. We have begun to rebuild our schools. Over 5 million children, boys and girls, are attending school today. We have also commenced to develop health centers to provide basic services to our people, especially to our women and children, who have suffered the most during the decades of war and turmoil. We have embarked upon the reconstruction of our roads to encourage traders and businessmen to transport products to markets. We have started to reconstitute our national army, our national institutions, national police in order to both defend our sovereignty and provide security to our citizens. Our national army is being trained by American forces, American troops. And wherever we have deployed them, the Afghan people have welcomed them. We have initiated the fight against narcotics to save our children, to save your children and children across the world from the evil of addiction to drugs. The confidence of our citizens in the future of our country is clearly signified by the return of 3 million refugees in the past two years. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, Afghanistan is the home of all Afghans. And to illustrate further, we have today in Afghanistan our former king, back in his old home. We have today in Afghanistan the leaders of the former resistance of Afghanistan against the Soviet Union. We have also millions of refugees who left Afghanistan because of tyranny and invasion. They're all back in their country, and more are returning. Ladies and gentlemen, Afghanistan has emerged from a very dark era, one of oppression and terror. We have adopted an enlightened constitution establishing a democratic Islamic government. It guarantees equal rights and equal protection for every citizen of our country. With your support, men and women of Afghanistan have now equal rights before the law and the constitution. The new constitution replaces the Taliban-imposed gender discrimination by assigning 25 percent of the seats in our future parliament for women. Together we have furthered democracy by creating a climate where 35 percent of the voters so far registered for our election are women. And as I speak today, ladies and gentlemen, I received a report this morning from the election commission. In the central part of the country, the registrators for voting are more than 50 percent women, and in the rest of the country, they are more than 30 percent. And as this process continues till September, we will have at least 6 to 7 million people registered, and I'm sure we will reach nearly 50 percent of them to be women. We have secured an open and inclusive society where minority languages are accorded official recognition and where the press enjoys unprecedented freedom. We, the Afghan people, have once again established ourselves as a proud and sovereign nation. And that with your support and commitment, and without the partnership between our two nations, none of this would have been achieved. Ladies and gentlemen, together we have come a long way, but our common journey is far from over. Many obstacles exist and numerous milestones remain to be reached before we can fully realize our shared vision of a stable, prosperous and democratic Afghanistan. We have to travel further. Private militias pose a threat to the consolidation of stability and democracy in our country. They continue to oppress people and challenge law, order and government authority. The Afghan people demand and insist on disarming and demobilizing private militias. Only with your support and that of the international community can we achieve this necessary goal. We are also confronted with the evil of narcotics. Drug profits finance private militias, terrorists and extremists. Drug profits undermine our effort to build a healthy and legitimate national economy. Drugs threaten the lives and future of children -- yours and ours. We are determined to cleanse Afghanistan from this menace. In the economic dimension, despite our achievements over the past two and a half years, we continue to be one of the poorest countries. We still have the second-highest infant and maternal mortality rates in the world. We have one of the highest illiteracy rates. Very few Afghans have access to safe drinking water. While our country has a rich hydroelectric potential, oil, gas and coal reserves, only 6 percent of the Afghans have reliable access to electricity. While Afghanistan has great rivers, our farmers, ironically, suffer from a shortage of water. Even now, our vast mineral resources, such as iron ore, copper and precious stones, remain undeveloped. Our delicious foods are not reaching major markets due to the lack of refrigeration and proper marketing. Ladies and gentlemen, these are significant impediments, yet we are confident that with your continued support and commitment, we, the Afghan people, will overcome them as we have triumphed over other challenges in the past two years. To succeed, we ask for your continued investment. Afghanistan is open for the business, and American companies are most welcome. Together we will make Afghanistan a great success and an enduring example of a prosperous, democratic society. Our shared success in Afghanistan is vital to achieving victory over the greatest menace the world faces today: terrorism and extremism. Long before the horrific tragedy of September 11th, terrorists subjected the people of Afghanistan to unspeakable brutality and oppression. Even though we were among the most pious Muslims in the world, we were the first and foremost victims of al Qaeda. In the name of Islam, a religion of peace and tolerance, they terrorized and killed the Muslim people of Afghanistan and deprived us of our basic rights. These atrocities continued for many years, and the world remained unengaged. The tragedy of September 11th once again tied the destinies of our two nations. You came to Afghanistan to defeat terrorism, and we Afghans welcomed and embraced you for the liberation of our country. Together we ended the rule of terrorism. Ladies and gentlemen, this was not the first time America confronted a great evil and rescued the world. Two weeks ago, on Memorial Day, you remembered the hundreds of thousands of American soldiers who gave their lives for defending democracy and freedom around the world. You led the world in eliminating fascism. You stood with the Afghan nation in our heroic fight against the former Soviet Union. Just last week we honored one of our great fellow freedom fighters in that struggle, the late President Ronald Reagan. Today the United States is once again leading the global effort to defeat terrorism and extremism. Afghanistan is a central front in this war against terrorism. The Afghan peoples are and will remain with you in this struggle. Ladies and gentlemen, in this great chamber, in the house of the American people, democracy and liberty triumph. Afghans are honored to have become partners in this noble tradition. The Afghan people will not forget your help, and will always remember and cherish your friendship. The Afghan people desire to further build on this solid foundation of mutual trust and friendship by creating a strong partnership between our two nations. We must build a partnership that will consolidate our achievements and enhance stability, prosperity and democracy in Afghanistan and in the region. This requires sustaining and accelerating the reconstruction of Afghanistan through long-term commitment, a free-trade agreement between the United States and Afghanistan, and providing incentives to the private sector for investing in Afghanistan. We must enhance our strategic partnership. The security of our two nations are intertwined. In December of 2001, a U.S. bomb went astray and exploded a few meters from where I was staying. This was the last day of our resistance against the Taliban. This was the day that the Bonn process announced me as the chairman. This was the day the Taliban were to come and surrender. And this was also the day that a stray bomb came to us and killed more than 20 of my people and also four U.S. soldiers. And in the middle of all that confusion and pain, an old man walked to me. I did not know him. I had not seen him before and I have not seen him since then. He came to me and said, ""Mr. Karzai, go to the Americans. Tell them that in a war like this, things like that happen. Tell them not to lose heart. Tell them that we shall continue to fight, and we must win."" And ladies and gentlemen, upon my arrival in the United States last week, I stopped at Fort Drum in New York to meet with some of your troops who had served in Afghanistan. Senator Clinton graciously came to receive us. We honored two American soldiers who recently returned from Afghanistan and who, a few months ago in Kandahar, were traveling in a vehicle. Somebody, a terrorist, threw a grenade at them. The grenade landed in their vehicle. They took the grenade. Instead of throwing it into the street, where there were people around them, civilians, these heroic men stuck the grenade under their seat. The grenade exploded. Fortunately, they survived, but they were badly injured. To us, this is also the example of heroism and care for humanity, and we are proud of these two American soldiers. These stories tell a tale of partnership, tell a tale of joint struggle, tell a tale of care and courage and care for humanity. Ladies and gentlemen, together we have a long road ahead, but we will move forward to make the world a better place. And for us in Afghanistan, we remember you for every help that you have given us, and we will have that in our books written in golden letter. In this road, the journey is one of success and victory. And we both have triumphed and we will continue to triumph and win the war against terrorism and make the world a better place for us and the rest of the world. And may God bless America and Afghanistan and our two nations. Thank you very much. I don't know how to respond -- I don't know how to respond to your kindness. Thank you very much. Thank you.",229,205,1,Republican,51,48,1,Republican,108
Jose Maria Aznar,Goverment of Spain ,230,2,2004,President ,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, honorable members of Congress, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin by thanking you most sincerely for the warm welcome you have extended to me this morning. I somehow have the feeling that you, like me, are looking forward to a short speech. As a parliamentarian and the prime minister of Spain, I am deeply honored to be invited to address the United States Congress. This chamber is a living symbol admired the world over of our common desire for freedom and democracy. I recall the great emotion the people of Spain felt on the 2nd of June, 1976, when King Juan Carlos I spoke from this very rostrum on the occasion of the commemoration of the bicentennial of American independence. In his speech, His Majesty the King emphasized the important Hispanic contribution to the formation and independence of this great nation. We in Spain were going through difficult and delicate times then. And from this rostrum, our king set out his vision of a prosperous and modern Spain and conveyed the Spanish peoples' desire for freedom and democracy. Today, 28 years on, Spain is fully consolidated as a democracy. The process of political decentralization, which was set in motion with the 1978 constitution, has been completed successfully. We are one of the great nations of Europe, active members of the European Union. We are a dynamic, open and enterprising country of 43 million people. Once an immigrant society, today we receive immigrants from the four corners of the world. We are the eighth- largest economy in the world today. Central to that achievement has been our membership of the European Union. Our economy is growing stably and with confidence at a rate above the average of our European Union partners. And, our economy has generated half of all the jobs created in Europe in recent years. The Spain of today knows full well that growth and maturity bring responsibilities also. We know that we have to face risks and shoulder commitments, commitments that must be met. We want to occupy a position in the first line of defense of democracy and the rule of law alongside friends and allies, in good times as well as in times of difficulty. We share with you values and principles. And let me say that our commitment to freedom is unwavering. Equally unwavering has been the commitment of the United States. And allow me to pay public tribute here today to the American people for the indispensable role that they have played in the fight for democracy and freedom. For the last eight years, it has been my privilege to serve as prime minister of Spain. At all times we have defended the value and validity of the Atlantic relationship for the good of Europe as well as for global stability and security. During my term in office, I have constantly worked towards that objective, firstly with the Clinton administration, and more recently with the Bush administration. Indeed, one of the greatest personal and political satisfactions gained from these years has been the relationship I have established and built up with these two great presidents. It comes as no surprise, then, that our relations are nothing short of exceptional at present. The Atlantic relationship strengthens Europeans and Americans alike, and it makes the world a safer and freer place. In working intensely to further the process of European union, Spain believes that the process has to be carried forward, while at the same time preserving and enhancing the Atlantic relationship. It is a relationship that lies at the very origins of Europe's construction. Having played a part in its development, it necessarily has to be part of its future also. That has always been our view and it still is our view today, just a few weeks before 10 new countries join the European Union as members. Many of those countries had to endure the tyranny of communism. Many of them now look to the Atlantic alliance to guarantee their freedom. As a European, let me say that I have no wish whatsoever for an alternative to the transatlantic relationship. I want no alternative to the Atlantic relationship. Wanting a strong European Union, as Spain does, and being at the vanguard of Europe, as Spain is, doesn't entail working to be a counter power to the United States. It means working towards an Atlantic-minded Europe. Given that we share the same principles and values, it is in our common interest to defend these. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, those very principles and values came under brutal attack on September the 11th, 2001. Nothing can make good the grief and suffering caused on that terrible day, when terrorists demonstrated their despicable contempt for human life. But the American people responded with an admirable lesson in civic- mindedness and responsibility. In so doing -- and let me make this absolutely clear -- they penned one of the most beautiful pages of our modern era. The United States were not the only targets of the September the 11th attacks. Terrorism threw down a calculated challenge to the values of our core humanity: freedom, moral decency, compassion and respect for the lives of others. Immediately after the attacks, Spain expressed its active solidarity and its commitment to the government and the people of the United States. Allow me here, in this chamber, to reiterate that solemn commitment today. Speaking in Madrid a few months before 9/11, President Bush expressed America's solidarity with Spain's fight against the terrorism that we have had to endure for too long. That solidarity has materialized in the form of active cooperation. We will never forget that gesture of support, and I will never forget it. The United States and Spain would both like to see the United Nations Counterterrorism Committee play a real and effective role. We would like to see a world list of terrorist organizations drawn up and approved. We also feel it important to ensure that the voice of the victims of terrorism is listened to permanently. Just 10 years ago, the first-ever World Congress of Victims of Terrorism was held in Madrid. The victims are the moral backbone that underpins our fight against terror; they give us valor, they give us courage. But at the same time, they also call us to account and demand results from us. They also demand justice and reparation. There can be no justification whatsoever for terrorism. It destroys the causes it purports to defend. The political or religious causes that terrorism allegedly serves are among its victims also. And allow me to say here today that terrorists must be made to realize that the only and inevitable outcome is defeat. We derive our strength from the moral superiority of democratic systems and as has occurred on past occasions in history, I have no doubt whatsoever that freedom will triumph over barbarity this time too. Today in Afghanistan and in Iraq, the most important phase of the fight against terrorism is currently taking place. In Iraq, terrorists are trying to prevent the Iraqi people from taking their own destiny in hand. We refused to countenance the repeated violations of international law by Saddam Hussein's tyranny. We remain committed to Iraq's material and institutional reconstruction and I can guarantee you that we fully intend to see our commitments through. At this point, I would like to pay a sincere tribute to all those who have given their lives in order to restore freedom to the Iraqi people, to guarantee the security and consolidate democracy. Our appreciation and gratitude will always be with those who have died. The fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is another common feature of our pursuit of a more stable and freer world. Recent progress in the fight against the proliferation of these weapons would not have been possible had it not been for the firm stance that we have taken. Proliferation poses a very real threat to everyone's security. Faced with the risk that these weapons might be used by terrorist groups, we cannot stand by and do nothing. In addressing this challenge, we have to act together and with resolve. To ignore this reality or to evade the real issue and the genuine priorities would not only be highly irresponsible, but would prove extremely costly in terms of our own security and freedom. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, the transatlantic link stands for freedom, freedom in all areas. And it is thanks to that freedom that North America and Europe are the two most prosperous regions in the world. Experience shows that free trade is a source of economic growth and wealth for everyone. And that is why I proposed recently, and reiterate here today, that we should create a great economic financial and trade zone between Europe and the United States by the year 2015. I'm sure that we can open up a new era of growth and stability that would benefit the rest of the world too. It is my belief that freedom brings prosperity. That's what I've tried to do in my country since 1996 through economic liberalizations and reforms. It is also the reason why, in Europe, I have promoted the initiatives that prioritize above all else liberalization, innovation and improved competitiveness. The very close relationship we have forged between our two countries includes a Latin American dimension also. For me, Latin America is a key continent for my country. Spain is the world's second-biggest investor in that region behind the United States. The countries of the region have made great efforts in recent decades to consolidate democratic regimes and free market economies. This, then, is a further reason for our desire to strengthen ties between Europe and Latin America. I'm convinced that the Atlantic relationship will not be complete until it embraces the American continent in its entirety. For the medium and long term, we should set ourselves the joint goal of building a veritable community of common values and interests, including a large free trade area, and rest assured that Spain is willing and ready to work towards that goal. The Hispanic communities in the United States represent the source of new and until very recently unimaginable opportunities for these closer ties between the United States, Latin America and Europe, and I myself have been a privileged witness to this emerging and very promising reality in Texas, in New Mexico, California, New York and Florida. Mention of Florida necessarily brings me to say something about Cuba and its large exiled population. Like so many Spaniards, I too come from a family with roots in Cuba. This Caribbean island is one of the last remaining anomalies of history not just in the Americas, but anywhere in the entire world, and I would like to reiterate my desire and hope here today that before too long Cuba can be welcomed into the fold of free nations. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, honorable members of the House, as prime minister of Spain, I have endeavored at all times to harness the trust which the people of my country have placed in me for the last eight years to help make Spain a safer, more prosperous, more committed and, consequently, more respected country. Relations between our two nations stretch back more than 200 years. Spain provided valuable support to the United States in its fight for independence. Thereafter, our relations may not always have been governed by understanding. However, there has never been a more propitious time than the present to undertake grand projects together. What we have achieved together in recent years has already served to create a strong relationship, a relationship between countries that are friends, allies and partners. And in concluding, may I say that in Spain, the American people have a friend from Europe. In Spain, the United States has a firm, strong and responsible ally. Let us continue to work together, together for the cause of democracy and freedom in the world. Thank you.",229,205,1,Republican,51,48,1,Republican,108
Tony Blair,United Kingdom ,200,7,2003,Prime Minister ,"Mr. Speaker and Mr. Vice President, honorable members of Congress, I'm deeply touched by that warm and generous welcome. That's more than I deserve and more than I'm used to, quite frankly. And let me begin by thanking you most sincerely for voting to award me the Congressional Gold Medal. But you, like me, know who the real heroes are: those brave service men and women, yours and ours, who fought the war and risk their lives still. And our tribute to them should be measured in this way, by showing them and their families that they did not strive or die in vain, but that through their sacrifice future generations can live in greater peace, prosperity and hope. Let me also express my gratitude to President Bush. Through the troubled times since September the 11th changed our world, we have been allies and friends. Thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership. Mr. Speaker, sir, my thrill on receiving this award was only a little diminished on being told that the first Congressional Gold Medal was awarded to George Washington for what Congress called his ""wise and spirited conduct"" in getting rid of the British out of Boston. On our way down here, Senator Frist was kind enough to show me the fireplace where, in 1814, the British had burnt the Congress Library. I know this is, kind of, late, but sorry. Actually, you know, my middle son was studying 18th century history and the American War of Independence, and he said to me the other day, ""You know, Lord North, Dad, he was the British prime minister who lost us America. So just think, however many mistakes you'll make, you'll never make one that bad."" Members of Congress, I feel a most urgent sense of mission about today's world. September 11 was not an isolated event, but a tragic prologue, Iraq another act, and many further struggles will be set upon this stage before it's over. There never has been a time when the power of America was so necessary or so misunderstood, or when, except in the most general sense, a study of history provides so little instruction for our present day. We were all reared on battles between great warriors, between great nations, between powerful forces and ideologies that dominated entire continents. And these were struggles for conquest, for land, or money, and the wars were fought by massed armies. And the leaders were openly acknowledged, the outcomes decisive. Today, none of us expect our soldiers to fight a war on our own territory. The immediate threat is not conflict between the world's most powerful nations. And why? Because we all have too much to lose. Because technology, communication, trade and travel are bringing us ever closer together. Because in the last 50 years, countries like yours and mine have tripled their growth and standard of living. Because even those powers like Russia or China or India can see the horizon, the future wealth, clearly and know they are on a steady road toward it. And because all nations that are free value that freedom, will defend it absolutely, but have no wish to trample on the freedom of others. We are bound together as never before. And this coming together provides us with unprecedented opportunity but also makes us uniquely vulnerable. And the threat comes because in another part of our globe there is shadow and darkness, where not all the world is free, where many millions suffer under brutal dictatorship, where a third of our planet lives in a poverty beyond anything even the poorest in our societies can imagine, and where a fanatical strain of religious extremism has arisen, that is a mutation of the true and peaceful faith of Islam. And because in the combination of these afflictions a new and deadly virus has emerged. The virus is terrorism whose intent to inflict destruction is unconstrained by human feeling and whose capacity to inflict it is enlarged by technology. This is a battle that can't be fought or won only by armies. We are so much more powerful in all conventional ways than the terrorists, yet even in all our might, we are taught humility. In the end, it is not our power alone that will defeat this evil. Our ultimate weapon is not our guns, but our beliefs. There is a myth that though we love freedom, others don't; that our attachment to freedom is a product of our culture; that freedom, democracy, human rights, the rule of law are American values, or Western values; that Afghan women were content under the lash of the Taliban; that Saddam was somehow beloved by his people; that Milosevic was Serbia's savior. Members of Congress, ours are not Western values, they are the universal values of the human spirit. And anywhere... Anywhere, anytime ordinary people are given the chance to choose, the choice is the same: freedom, not tyranny; democracy, not dictatorship; the rule of law, not the rule of the secret police. The spread of freedom is the best security for the free. It is our last line of defense and our first line of attack. And just as the terrorist seeks to divide humanity in hate, so we have to unify it around an idea. And that idea is liberty. We must find the strength to fight for this idea and the compassion to make it universal. Abraham Lincoln said, ""Those that deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves."" And it is this sense of justice that makes moral the love of liberty. In some cases where our security is under direct threat, we will have recourse to arms. In others, it will be by force of reason. But in all cases, to the same end: that the liberty we seek is not for some but for all, for that is the only true path to victory in this struggle. But first we must explain the danger. Our new world rests on order. The danger is disorder. And in today's world, it can now spread like contagion. The terrorists and the states that support them don't have large armies or precision weapons; they don't need them. Their weapon is chaos. The purpose of terrorism is not the single act of wanton destruction. It is the reaction it seeks to provoke: economic collapse, the backlash, the hatred, the division, the elimination of tolerance, until societies cease to reconcile their differences and become defined by them. Kashmir, the Middle East, Chechnya, Indonesia, Africa--barely a continent or nation is unscathed. The risk is that terrorism and states developing weapons of mass destruction come together. And when people say, ""That risk is fanciful,"" I say we know the Taliban supported Al Qaida. We know Iraq under Saddam gave haven to and supported terrorists. We know there are states in the Middle East now actively funding and helping people, who regard it as God's will in the act of suicide to take as many innocent lives with them on their way to God's judgment. Some of these states are desperately trying to acquire nuclear weapons. We know that companies and individuals with expertise sell it to the highest bidder, and we know that at least one state, North Korea, lets its people starve while spending billions of dollars on developing nuclear weapons and exporting the technology abroad. This isn't fantasy, it is 21st-century reality, and it confronts us now. Can we be sure that terrorism and weapons of mass destruction will join together? Let us say one thing: If we are wrong, we will have destroyed a threat that at its least is responsible for inhuman carnage and suffering. That is something I am confident history will forgive. But if our critics are wrong, if we are right, as I believe with every fiber of instinct and conviction I have that we are, and we do not act, then we will have hesitated in the face of this menace when we should have given leadership. That is something history will not forgive. But precisely because the threat is new, it isn't obvious. It turns upside-down our concepts of how we should act and when, and it crosses the frontiers of many nations. So just as it redefines our notions of security, so it must refine our notions of diplomacy. There is no more dangerous theory in international politics than that we need to balance the power of America with other competitive powers; different poles around which nations gather. Such a theory may have made sense in 19th-century Europe. It was perforce the position in the Cold War. Today, it is an anachronism to be discarded like traditional theories of security. And it is dangerous because it is not rivalry but partnership we need; a common will and a shared purpose in the face of a common threat. And I believe any alliance must start with America and Europe. If Europe and America are together, the others will work with us. If we split, the rest will play around, play us off and nothing but mischief will be the result of it. You may think after recent disagreements it can't be done, but the debate in Europe is open. Iraq showed that when, never forget, many European nations supported our action. And it shows it still when those that didn't agreed Resolution 1483 in the United Nations for Iraq's reconstruction. Today, German soldiers lead in Afghanistan, French soldiers lead in the Congo where they stand between peace and a return to genocide. So we should not minimize the differences, but we should not let them confound us either. You know, people ask me after the past months when, let's say, things were a trifle strained in Europe, ""Why do you persist in wanting Britain at the center of Europe?"" And I say, ""Well, maybe if the U.K. were a group of islands 20 miles off Manhattan, I might feel differently. But actually, we're 20 miles off Calais and joined by a tunnel."" We are part of Europe, and we want to be. But we also want to be part of changing Europe. Europe has one potential for weakness. For reasons that are obvious, we spent roughly a thousand years killing each other in large numbers. The political culture of Europe is inevitably rightly based on compromise. Compromise is a fine thing except when based on an illusion. And I don't believe you can compromise with this new form of terrorism. But Europe has a strength. It is a formidable political achievement. Think of the past and think of the unity today. Think of it preparing to reach out even to Turkey--a nation of vastly different culture, tradition, religion--and welcome it in. But my real point is this: Now Europe is at the point of transformation. Next year, 10 new countries will join. Romania and Bulgaria will follow. Why will these new European members transform Europe? Because their scars are recent, their memories strong, their relationship with freedom still one of passion, not comfortable familiarity. They believe in the trans-Atlantic alliance. They support economic reform. They want a Europe of nations, not a super state. They are our allies and they are yours. So don't give up on Europe. Work with it. To be a serious partner, Europe must take on and defeat the anti-Americanism that sometimes passes for its political discourse. And what America must do is show that this is a partnership built on persuasion, not command. Then the other great nations of our world and the small will gather around in one place, not many. And our understanding of this threat will become theirs. And the United Nations can then become what it should be: an instrument of action as well as debate. The Security Council should be reformed. We need a new international regime on the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. And we need to say clearly to United Nations members: ""If you engage in the systematic the mission the coalition. But let us start preferring a coalition and acting alone if we have to, not the other way around. True, winning wars is not easier that way, but winning the peace is. And we have to win both. And you have an extraordinary record of doing so. Who helped Japan renew, or Germany reconstruct, or Europe get back on its feet after World War II? America. So when we invade Afghanistan or Iraq, our responsibility does not end with military victory. Finishing the fighting is not finishing the job. So if Afghanistan needs more troops from the international community to police outside Kabul, our duty is to get them. Let us help them eradicate their dependency on the poppy, the crop whose wicked residue turns up on the streets of Britain as heroin to destroy young British lives, as much as their harvest warps the lives of Afghans. We promised Iraq democratic government. We will deliver it. We promised them the chance to use their oil wealth to build prosperity for all their citizens, not a corrupt elite, and we will do so. We will stay with these people so in need of our help until the job is done. And then reflect on this: How hollow would the charges of American imperialism be when these failed countries are and are seen to be transformed from states of terror to nations of prosperity, from governments of dictatorship to examples of democracy, from sources of instability to beacons of calm. And how risible would be the claims that these were wars on Muslims if the world could see these Muslim nations still Muslim, but with some hope for the future, not shackled by brutal regimes whose principal victims were the very Muslims they pretended to protect? It would be the most richly observed advertisement for the values of freedom we can imagine. When we removed the Taliban and Saddam Hussein, this was not imperialism. For these oppressed people, it was their liberation. And why can the terrorists even mount an argument in the Muslim world that it isn't? Because there is one cause terrorism rides upon, a cause they have no belief in but can manipulate. I want to be very plain: This terrorism will not be defeated without peace in the Middle East between Israel and Palestine. Here it is that the poison is incubated. Here it is that the extremist is able to confuse in the mind of a frighteningly large number of people the case for a Palestinian state and the destruction of Israel, and to translate this moreover into a battle between East and West, Muslim, Jew and Christian. May this never compromise the security of the state of Israel. The state of Israel should be recognized by the entire Arab world, and the vile propaganda used to indoctrinate children, not just against Israel but against Jews, must cease. You cannot teach people hate and then ask them to practice peace. But neither can you teach people peace except by according them dignity and granting them hope. Innocent Israelis suffer. So do innocent Palestinians. The ending of Saddam's regime in Iraq must be the starting point of a new dispensation for the Middle East: Iraq, free and stable; Iran and Syria, who give succor to the rejectionist men of violence, made to realize that the world will no longer countenance it, that the hand of friendship can only be offered them if they resile completely from this malice, but that if they do, that hand will be there for them and their people; the whole of region helped toward democracy. And to symbolize it all, the creation of an independent, viable and democratic Palestinian state side by side with the state of Israel. What the president is doing in the Middle East is tough but right. And let me at this point thank the president for his support, and that of President Clinton before him, and the support of members of this Congress, for our attempts to bring peace to Northern Ireland. You know, one thing I've learned about peace processes: They're always frustrating, they're often agonizing, and occasionally they seem hopeless. But for all that, having a peace process is better than not having one. And why has a resolution of Palestine such a powerful appeal across the world? Because it embodies an even-handed approach to justice, just as when this president recommended and this Congress supported a $15 billion increase in spending on the world's poorest nations to combat HIV/AIDS. It was a statement of concern that echoed rightly around the world. There can be no freedom for Africa without justice and no justice without declaring war on Africa's poverty, disease and famine with as much vehemence as we removed the tyrant and the terrorists. In Mexico in September, the world should unite and give us a trade round that opens up our markets. I'm for free trade, and I'll tell you why: because we can't say to the poorest people in the world, ""We want you to be free, but just don't try to sell your goods in our market."" And because ever since the world started to open up, it has prospered. And that prosperity has to be environmentally sustainable, too. You know, I remember at one of our earliest international meetings, a European prime minister telling President Bush that the solution was quite simple: Just double the tax on American gasoline. Your president gave him a most eloquent look. It reminded me of the first leader of my party, Keir Hardy, in the early part of the 20th century. He was a man who used to correspond with the Pankhursts, the great campaigners for women's votes. And shortly before the election, June 1913, one of the Pankhursts sisters wrote to Hardy saying she had been studying Britain carefully and there was a worrying rise in sexual immorality linked to heavy drinking. So she suggested he fight the election on the platform of votes for women, chastity for men and prohibition for all. He replied saying, ""Thank you for your advice. The electoral benefits of which are not immediately discernible."" We all get that kind of advice, don't we? But frankly, we need to go beyond even Kyoto, and science and technology is the way. Climate change, deforestation, the voracious drain on natural resources cannot be ignored. Unchecked, these forces will hinder the economic development of the most vulnerable nations first and ultimately all nations. So we must show the world that we are willing to step up to these challenges around the world and in our own backyards. Members of Congress, if this seems a long way from the threat of terror and weapons of mass destruction, it is only to say again that the world security cannot be protected without the world's heart being one. So America must listen as well as lead. But, members of Congress, don't ever apologize for your values. Tell the world why you're proud of America. Tell them when the Star-Spangled Banner starts, Americans get to their feet, Hispanics, Irish, Italians, Central Europeans, East Europeans, Jews, Muslims, white, Asian, black, those who go back to the early settlers and those whose English is the same as some New York cab driver's I've dealt with ... but whose sons and daughters could run for this Congress. Tell them why Americans, one and all, stand upright and respectful. Not because some state official told them to, but because whatever race, color, class or creed they are, being American means being free. That's why they're proud. As Britain knows, all predominant power seems for a time invincible, but, in fact, it is transient. The question is: What do you leave behind? And what you can bequeath to this anxious world is the light of liberty. That is what this struggle against terrorist groups or states is about. We're not fighting for domination. We're not fighting for an American world, though we want a world in which America is at ease. We're not fighting for Christianity, but against religious fanaticism of all kinds. And this is not a war of civilizations, because each civilization has a unique capacity to enrich the stock of human heritage. We are fighting for the inalienable right of humankind--black or white, Christian or not, left, right or a million different--to be free, free to raise a family in love and hope, free to earn a living and be rewarded by your efforts, free not to bend your knee to any man in fear, free to be you so long as being you does not impair the freedom of others. That's what we're fighting for. And it's a battle worth fighting. And I know it's hard on America, and in some small corner of this vast country, out in Nevada or Idaho or these places I've never been to, but always wanted to go... I know out there there's a guy getting on with his life, perfectly happily, minding his own business, saying to you, the political leaders of this country, ""Why me? And why us? And why America?"" And the only answer is, ""Because destiny put you in this place in history, in this moment in time, and the task is yours to do."" And our job, my nation that watched you grow, that you fought alongside and now fights alongside you, that takes enormous pride in our alliance and great affection in our common bond, our job is to be there with you. You are not going to be alone. We will be with you in this fight for liberty. We will be with you in this fight for liberty. And if our spirit is right and our courage firm, the world will be with us. Thank you.",229,205,1,Republican,51,48,1,Republican,108
John Howard ,Australia ,900,6,2002,Prime Minister ,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. President of the Senate, distinguished members of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the Congress of the United States, may I say how very touched I am by the warmth and generosity of your welcome. I appreciate very deeply the honor that you have extended to me today, and more importantly the honor you have extended to my country Australia. Can I on behalf of over 19 million freedom loving Australians convey to you their deep affection and their warm greetings and their sense of solidarity and friendship. The bonds between Americans and Australians are as strong as they are genuine. And that is because we share so many values in common. A belief that the individual is more important than the State. A belief that strong families are a nation's greatest resource. A belief that competitive capitalism is the real key to national wealth. And a belief that decency and hard work define a person's worth, not class or race or social background. My friends, let me say to you today that America has no better friend anywhere in the world than Australia. Australians and Americans enjoy each other's company. We share a love of sport and in some of them we are fierce competitors. And we even from time to time share the Academy Awards. When I last came to this great chamber of democracy on the 12th of September last year, the smoke still hung in the air over New York and Washington. Brave and courageous policemen and firemen with no regard to their own safety, searched in the hope of finding survivors. The scale of loss and destruction was yet to be fully calculated. In seeking justice and not revenge, in choosing calm consideration over blind fury, in turning to friends before turning on enemies, the United States over recent months has led a great reaffirmation of all of those great values and principles on which both of our societies are based. America fought back magnificently – and in the process has won the admiration of the world. You demonstrated to the world that where fundamental freedoms flourish, evil men can do their worst, cause death and devastation but in the end they will never win. In his inaugural address, George Washington spoke of the destiny of the American people to preserve ‘the sacred fire of liberty.' That promise has been kept for more than two centuries – but never more so than since the appalling events of September last year. Through these times Australians have shared your shock and anger and have been partners in your resolve. We have taken our place beside you in the fight against terrorism, because what happened last year in the United States was as much an attack upon our nation and the values that we hold dear, as it was upon yours. As we meet, Australian and American troops are fighting side by side in Afghanistan. And it is our constant prayer that they all return safely home to their loved ones. In these past months President Bush has displayed the tenacity, the strength and the depth of character of a very great leader. And he is also applying those great qualities to the tensions in the Indian sub-continent between India and Pakistan and the intractable situation in the Middle East. It is a special privilege for me to return to this historic place, to address the representatives of a great nation whose people we hold in such high regard and who we feel great warmth and affection towards. Like you, Australia enters the new century strong and prosperous. Over the past decade, the productivity and growth of our economy has been ahead of most other developed nations. Our pioneer past, so similar to your own, has produced a spirit that can overcome adversity and pursue great dreams. We've pursued a society of opportunity, fairness and hope, leaving – as you did – the divisions and prejudices of the Old World far behind. Like your own, our culture continues to be immeasurably enriched by immigration from the four corners of the world. We believe as you do that nations are strengthened not weakened, broadened and not diminished, by a variety of views and an atmosphere of open debate. Most of all, we value loyalty given and loyalty gained. The concept of mateship runs deeply through the Australian character. We cherish and where necessary we will fight to defend the liberties we hold dear. Australian and American forces fought together for the first time in the Battle of Hamel, in France, in World War I. The date of the attack – the 4th of July 1918 - was deliberately chosen by the Australian Commander, General John Monash, to honor your countrymen. One of the Australian units held in reserve for that attack was the Third Pioneer Battalion, and it had a young signalman called Lyall Howard. He was my father. From that moment to this, we've been able to count on each other when it has mattered most. Let me say, and I know I speak on behalf of all of my fellow Australians, in saying that we will never forget the crucial help that America extended to us during the darkest days of World War II. Without that help, our history and our society would have been totally different. Successive generations of Australians and Americans have fought side by side in every major conflict of the twentieth century – in the jungles of New Guinea, in Korea, in Vietnam, in the Gulf, in skies and oceans around the globe and now, in another new century, among the rock-strewn mountains of Afghanistan. The ANZUS Treaty of 1951 pledged each country to come to the aid of the other if it were under attack. And so it was that in a United States Airforce plane made available to me on the 12th of September last year to enable me to return to Australia, and high above the Pacific Ocean, I informed the United States Ambassador to Australia Tom Schieffer that it was our intention for the first time in the 50 year history of the ANZUS Treaty, to invoke that Treaty in response to the attack upon America. America was under attack. Australia was immediately there to help. My friends, both of our societies are built on a deep respect for the worth of each individual. “The worth of a state, in the long run” wrote John Stuart Mill in 1859 “ is the worth of the individuals composing it … a state which dwarfs its men in order that they may be more docile instruments in its hands even for beneficial purposes – will find with small men no great thing can really be accomplished”. America and Australia are societies which extol the precious worth of each individual man and woman. Like you I see family life at the heart of a nation's existence. Not only does the family nurture and educate our children but it provides emotional anchorage for all of us as we travel through life. The strength of the family of course goes beyond the spiritual and the emotional. United, caring families are the best social welfare system mankind has ever devised. Both of our societies draw great strength from the spirit of volunteerism. The huge, exuberant success of the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000 owed a lot to the warmth and infectious dedication of tens of thousands of volunteers. They gave the Games a sense of exhilaration and joy which contributed enormously to their success. Edmund Burke once called voluntary groups society's “small platoons”. They are in fact the living tissue between the government and the people. I think we would all agree that political life in both of our nations is undergoing great change. I find, as I am sure you do, that politics now is a lot less tribal than it used to be. Lifelong allegiances are looser and less frequent. Modern society has given young people infinitely more options than was the case a generation ago. Governments must be decisive but also modest. Grand gestures without practical results help no-one. People want outcomes not political fireworks and constant battles. And above all, they want space from governments to get on with their own lives. I've spoken much of our common values, our shared history and our deep respect and affection for each other as peoples. Let me say that we also share a common interest in spreading and better understanding the benefits of globalization. The balance sheet of globalization is overwhelmingly favorable to mankind. We must, however, better understand and explain its advantages to all of our citizens. Trade reform and liberalization have delivered benefits to people in many countries and I believe they can deliver much more. I understand that the demands of local constituencies and international responsibilities must be finely balanced. As a true friend let me say candidly that Australia was intensely disappointed with the passage of the recent Farm Bill. It will damage Australia's farmers. They are efficient producers with very little government support. I know that the farm and export subsidies of, for example, the European Union are much greater than those of the United States. Indeed, OECD agricultural subsidies are two-thirds of Africa's total Gross Domestic Product. The cost of these subsidies is at least three times all of the Overseas Development Aid to developing countries. This only serves to illustrate the urgent need for global reform of agriculture within the World Trade Organization framework. The challenge is to achieve a comprehensive Doha trade round. And that will require close cooperation and collaboration between Australia and the United States within the WTO. American leadership will be crucial. May I respectfully express the hope that Congress gives the President full authority to negotiate new trade agreements. At the same time, we in America and Australia have an historic opportunity to give even greater momentum to our bilateral economic relationship. And that is why Australia has proposed the negotiation of a free trade agreement between our two countries. A comprehensive free trade agreement, by boosting trade and investment between us, would add a stronger economic dimension to the very deep bilateral ties that are already there. Turning for a moment to the strategic challenges of our own region, let me say that Australia welcomes and encourages a full and active engagement by the United States in the Asia Pacific. It is immensely important not only to the nations of that region, but also to the interests of the United States. There is no region in the world more dynamic and changing more rapidly than the Asia Pacific region. For ourselves, Australia is proud of the leadership role that we were able to play in East Timor. And to share the great independence celebration of that tiny country of fewer than a million people only a few weeks ago, and savor for a moment their sense of hope and exhilaration was a very moving experience. We stand ready to work in partnership with America to advance the cause of freedom, particularly in our shared Pacific region. Mr. Speaker, Mr. President of the Senate, ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, you have as I said at the beginning, paid a great honor and compliment to me, but more particularly to my nation Australia, in inviting me to address you today. Our relationship has been long. The ties between us are strong. The bonds, on a people to people basis between Americans and Australians are deep and rich. This relationship is nourished by many things. It is nourished by shared history. It is nourished by common commitment to democratic ideals and values. And it is nourished by our deep and resolute commitment to the role of the individual in society and the place of the family in the national framework of both of our nations. I express to you on behalf of my fellow countrymen and women a sense of commitment to the constant struggle to preserve democracy and freedom around the world. I say it with great warmth because there is nothing false or phony or lacking in spontaneity in the relationship between our two peoples. It is not contrived. It is genuine. We like each other and we don't mind saying it. Could I say to you today that as we move forward into this new century, we do so in the knowledge that no matter what will happen - and there will be many paths of difficulty requiring courage and grit and sacrifice - we travel through the century in the constant company of a true and great friend. May God bless peoples of America and Australia. Thank you.",221,212,2,Republican,49,50,1,Democrat,107
Vincente Fox ,Mexico ,70,9,2001,President ,"Thank you very much. I am sure this applause and this warm welcoming has been heard by 100 million Mexicans which, in the name of them, I thank all of you for being so kind with us in Mexico. Honorable Members of the Congress of the United States of America: It is a distinct honor for me to meet you here in the oldest legislative assembly on the American continent, a Congress whose deliberations have had such a strong influence not only on the history of this country, but of the entire world. This is an historic moment between our two nations in which the governments of Mexico and the United States have decided to begin a new era of friendship and cooperation to benefit both our peoples. Mexico and the United States wish to bring together our principles and interests as well as our traditions and hopes. The meeting of our two countries at the dawning of this new century may represent the beginning of the most promising chapters in our common history. My presence in this chamber bears witness to that will to bring our countries closer together. It is our very firm wish, as Mexicans and Americans, to establish a new relationship, a more mature, full, and equitable relationship based on mutual trust. Honorable Members of the United States Congress: I stand before you today with a simple message: Trust needs to be the key element of our new relationship. I am aware that for many Americans and for many Mexicans, the idea of trusting their neighbor may seem risky and, perhaps, even unwise. I am sure that many on both sides of the border would rather stick to the old saying that, ""Good fences make good neighbors."" These perceptions have deep roots in history. In Mexico, they derive from a long held sense of suspicion and apprehension about its powerful neighbor. And in the United States, they stem from previous experiences with a political regime governing Mexico, which for the most part was regarded as undemocratic and untrustworthy. Our countries thus cautiously distance themselves from one another to suit this frame of mind, but circumstances have changed them. We're now bound closely together, whether in trade or tourism, economic or family ties, our links are countless and ever growing. No two nations are more important to the immediate prosperity and well being of one another than Mexico and the United States. That is why our two great nations must go forward, together, to establish wider and deeper forms of cooperation and understanding. In this task, trust will be essential to achieve our goals. We must, therefore, leave behind the suspicion and indifference that have so often in the past been the source of misunderstandings between our two peoples; for it is only by engaging more fully as neighbors and partners that we can make a difference to our societies, and we now have before us a historic opportunity to achieve this end which has proved so elusive in the past. We intend to be forthright in our friendship and unwavering in our commitment. For as Corinthians states so simply and truly: ""Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful."" The relationship between Mexico and the United States has changed in one fundamental way: True democracy in Mexico, for decades an unfulfilled dream, is now a reality. As a result of last year's vote, Mexico now has a legitimate and truly democratic leadership. This has meant a change in government, but it is also a reflection of a profound change in the values and aspirations of Mexican society. I am, therefore, determined to make democracy and tolerance the principles that guide all government actions, and to ensure that public institutions in Mexico become the guarantors of the rights and highest aspirations of citizens. I have also pledged to address the most pressing problems now confronting Mexico, some of which are perhaps unintended, but nonetheless tangible legacies of an authoritarian past -- among them, poverty and inequality that for so many decades have condemned millions of Mexicans to a life of disadvantage and insecurity; the crippling disease of corruption, which has had such an insidious effect on the life of our country; and the fragility and weakness of our judicial system, which itself must be reformed in order to bring an end to impunity and to consolidate the rule of law throughout the country. I am convinced that it is time to bring Mexico up to date on all fronts, both within and beyond our borders. It is also time to bring Mexico up to date in its relations with the United States. Both of our nations now fully share, without qualification, the fundamental values of freedom and democracy. Thanks to those democratic changes inaugurated in Mexico last year on July the 2nd, the time has come for Mexico and the United States to trust each other. Simple trust. That is what has been sorely absent in our relationship in the past, and that is what is required for us to propel and strengthen our relationship in the days, weeks, and years to come. Let us foster trust between our societies. Let us build trust along our common border. Let us take the road less-traveled-by and build confidence every step of the way. Only trust will allow us to constructively tackle the challenges our two nations face as we undertake to build a new partnership in North America. Take, for example, our common struggle against the scourge of drugs. It should be clear by now that no government, however powerful, will be able to defeat on its own the forces of transnational organized crime that lie behind drug trafficking. Intense cooperation is required to confront this threat, and trust is certainly a prerequisite of cooperation. This is why, since I took office last year, Mexico has enhanced its cooperation with U.S. authorities. We have arrested key drug kingpins and extradited drug traffickers wanted by the United States Justice Department. However, much more needs to be done. Trust will be crucial to enhance intelligence and information sharing between both governments. We are committed to becoming a full partner with the United States in the fight against drugs. But trust requires that one partner not to be judged unilaterally by the other. Members of this Honorable Congress: Give trust a chance. Give both governments a chance. The bill to suspend drug certification for 3 years, S.219, will allow us to move forward. In the fight against drugs, cooperation is not a nicety; it is a necessity. We ask that you demonstrate your trust in us by passing this legislation as a gesture of your faith and confidence in this new country that we are working so hard to build. We must also trust each other if we are to deal successfully with the issue of migration. In recent months, President George Bush and I have already shown our willingness to trust each other by agreeing to discuss this most complex matter. As the history of this country shows, migration has always rendered more economic benefits to the United States than the costs it entails. Let us also not forget that migrants invariably enrich the cultural life of the land that receives them. Many among you have a parent or a grandparent who came into this country as an immigrant from another land. Therefore, allow me to take this opportunity to pay homage to those brave men and women who in the past took on the challenge of building a new life for themselves and for their families in this country. And let me also salute the Mexican migrants living in this country and say to them, Mexico needs you. We need your talent and your entrepreneurship. We need you to come home one day and play a part in building a strong Mexico. When you return and when you retire, we need you to come back and help us convince other Mexicans that the future lies in a prosperous and democratic Mexico. My dear countrymen, Mexico will not forget you, and will support you. We will not fail you. There is one crucial fact that we must not lose sight of. Migration flows that respond to deep underlying economic incentives are all but impossible to stop and must instead be regulated. Mexico is therefore seeking an agreement that will lend greater security and orderliness to the migration flows between our two countries. This is why trust in dealing with migration entails reaching common ground to address the status of Mexican migrants already working and living in the United States, already contributing to enrich this Nation. Let me be clear about this: regularization does not mean rewarding those who break the law. Regularization means that we will provide them with the legal means to allow them to continue contributing to this great Nation. The agreement that we seek would establish a higher ceiling for permanent visas awarded to Mexicans coming to this country, and it would also expand opportunities for Mexican workers to obtain temporary work visas so that they can enter the United States safely and legally. Additionally, the agreement would require us to enhance our cooperative efforts to improve border safety, save lives, and crack down on criminal smuggling gangs, or polleros. And, finally, it would demand that we promote economic growth in Mexico. And we know this is our responsibility, to promote specific opportunities for all those kids and young persons specifically in those regions that are the source of most migrants. Progress regarding migration will not be easy. Yet it is essential that we maintain our commitment to an open and frank discussion, so that we may find a lasting solution that is acceptable to both our countries. Such a discussion can only take place in a climate of trust. We have a fundamental decision to make. It is a decision that provides us with an opportunity to achieve the highest aspiration of any politician -- leaving a lasting legacy of well-being to their people. Mexico and the United States must also work constructively to promote our common values within our region. By adopting a clear and consistent stance, our governments may jointly address some of the most relevant and pressing issues of our hemisphere, such as the deepening of democracy and the promotion of human rights. This should not be our most noble cause in the Americas -- excuse me, this should be our most noble cause in the Americas and in the rest of the world. On issues of common concern, such as the situation in Colombia, the promotion of economic development across Central America, the establishment of the Free Trade Area of the Americas, the negotiation of a democratic charter for the OAS, or the shared goal of fostering financial stability and disarming financial crises throughout our region, it is vital that Mexico and the United States work together, each one as a partner that we are, in building peace and stability throughout the Americas on the basis of our own principles and interests. Evidently, we will not always see eye to eye. But both countries should convey to each other, in all sincerity and candor, their respective perceptions about how best to tackle issues of common concern for the well-being of our peoples. Trust will allow us to do this. Ladies and Gentlemen of the Congress of the United States of America: We have before us today the opportunity to dramatically change the future of our relationship. This meeting between Mexico and the United States is today the meeting between two democracies willing to build a better future. The relationship between Mexico and the United States is now in our hands. It is up to us to open wide the windows of opportunity before us. We are the architects of our common destiny. This means that we must re-create the relationship between our two great nations in a conscious and deliberate manner, moving forward firmly without leaving anything to chance. We must fully share this commitment in order to later enjoy together the fruits of our common labors. Obviously, we all know full well that there are no easy answers nor magical solutions to the challenges faced by Mexico and the United States, but there is a path along which we can make progress with firm steps towards their solution: the path of mutual trust; trust that our governments will always behave with integrity in their daily work, trust that the strength of our relationship as partners and friends is strong, trust in our future of shared prosperity. Honorable Members of the U.S. Congress: The political change currently under way in Mexico is the most powerful reason why we are now able to establish new forms of friendship and cooperation with the United States. We are ready to turn this change into the seed of a better future for both of our countries. I hope that the United States will embrace this historic opportunity to build a new era of prosperity and understanding between our peoples. It requires will, as well as vision, to take advantage of this favorable turn in history and forge a new friendship between Mexicans and Americans. This legislative body, along with its peers in Mexico, can play a decisive role in bringing our two countries together. You are a key partner in fostering trust between our two peoples. Years ago, the United States Congress faced a difficult decision and chose to vote in favor of a greater integration with Mexico through the North American Free Trade Agreement. The partnership between Mexico and the United States is still incomplete. There remain many unresolved issues that must be dealt with in order to achieve our common goals, now as partners. One of these goals is an issue which this great body will soon consider and which entails an important obligation under NAFTA; it is the issue of access to the United States for Mexican trucks. For this, as in many other items of our common agenda, we need your trust. Trust will allow both countries to comply responsibly and maturely with their obligations to one another. The overarching question is not, then, whether we can afford to trust each other, but whether we can afford not to. The growing convergence of our nations can lead to shared responsibility and prosperity and to the strengthening of those values that we have in common. Let us begin anew, as those who founded our modern nations once did, remembering on both sides that there can be no friendship without trust and no trust without true commitment. When history comes knocking on our doors, as it has done now, bold decisions are required. Let us make one today. Let us decide to trust one another. John F. Kennedy believed in new beginnings. In accepting his party's nomination as President he spoke of a New Frontier, ""We stand today on the edge of a New Frontier...the New Frontier of which I speak is not a set of promises. It is a set of challenges.” That was in 1960. Today, at the dawn of a new century, our two great nations face new challenges. But we do so with new opportunities, unimaginable even a few years ago. Our new frontier will be conquered not by confrontation, but through cooperation; not by threats, but by common aspirations; not by fear, but by trust. My friends, let us pledge today to create a new special partnership between the United States and Mexico for the benefit of our two great peoples. Ladies and Gentlemen: Long live Mexico! Long live the United States! Long live our common future!",221,212,2,Republican,49,50,1,Democrat,107
Atal Bihari Vajpayee,India ,750,10,2000,Prime Minister,"Mr Speaker, Mr President Pro tem, Honourable Members of the United State Congress, It is with a deep sense of honour that I speak to you today. I would like to thank you, Mr Speaker, and the members of the Congress for giving me this opportunity. In November 1999 a remarkable event took place in the House of Representatives. By a vote of 396 to 4, the House adopted a resolution congratulating India and my government on the successful elections completed in October 1999. This display of broad-based bipartisan support for strengthening relations with India is heartening. It is a source of encouragement to both President Clinton and to me, as we work together to infuse a new quality in our ties. I thank you for the near-unique approach that you have adopted towards my country. Those of you who saw the warm response to President Clinton's speech to our Parliament in March this year will recognise that similar cross-party support exists in India as well for deeper engagement with the USA. I am also deeply touched by the resolution adopted in the House two days ago welcoming my visit and the prospect of closer Indo-US understanding. Mr Speaker, American people have shown that democracy and individual liberty provide the conditions in which knowledge progresses, science discovers, innovation occurs, enterprise thrives and, ultimately, people advance. To more than a million and half from my country, America is now home. In turn, their industry, enterprise and skills are contributing to the advancement of American society. I see in the outstanding success of the Indian community in America, a metaphor of the vast potential that exists in Indo-US relations, and what we can achieve together. Just as American experience has been a lesson in what people can achieve in a democratic framework, India has been the laboratory of a democratic process rising to meet the strongest challenges that can be flung at it. In the half century of our independent existence, we have woven an exquisite tapestry. Out of diversity we have brought unity. The several languages of India speak with one voice under the roof of our Parliament. In your remarkable experiment as a nation state, you have proven the same truth. Out of the huddled masses that you welcomed to your shores you have created a great nation. For me the most gratifying of the many achievements of Indian democracy has been the change it has brought to the lives of the weak and the vulnerable. To give just one figure, in recent years it has enabled more than a million women in small towns and distant villages to enter local elected councils and to decide on issues that touch upon their lives. Two years ago, while much of Asia was convulsed by economic crisis, India held its course. In the last ten years, we have grown at 6.5 per cent per year: that puts India among the ten fastest growing economies of the world. Economic activity gets more and more diversified by the year: President Clinton and many among the friends gathered here have had occasion to glimpse our advances in information technology. We are determined to sustain the momentum of our economy: our aim is to double our per capita income in ten years -- and that means we must grow at 9 per cent a year. To achieve this order of growth we have ushered in comprehensive reforms. We are committed to releasing the creative genius of our people, the entrepreneurial skills of the men and women of the country, of its scientists and craftsmen. At the same time, we in India, remain committed to the primacy of the State in fulfilling its social obligations to the deprived, the weak and the poor. Important sectors of the country's infrastructure -- power, insurance, banking, telecom -- are being opened to private initiative, domestic and foreign. Trade barriers are being lowered. Mr Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, There are forces outside our country that believe that they can use terror to unravel the territorial integrity of India. They wish to show that a multi-religious society cannot exit. They pursue a task in which they are doomed to fail. No country has faced as ferocious an attack of terrorist violence as India has over the past two decades: 21,000 were killed by foreign sponsored terrorists in Punjab alone, 16,000 have been killed in Jammu and Kashmir. As many of you here in the Congress have in recent hearings recognised a stark fact: no region is a greater source of terrorism than our neighbourhood. Indeed, in our neighbourhood -- in this, the 21st century -- religious war has not just been fashioned into, it has been proclaimed to be, an instrument of State policy. Distance offers no insulation. It should not cause complacence. You know, and I know: such evil cannot succeed. But even in foiling it could inflict untold suffering. That is why the United States and India have begun to deepen their cooperation for combating terrorism. We must redouble these efforts. Mr Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, There was a time when we were on the other side of each other's globes. Today, on the digital map, India and the United States are neighbours and partners. India and the United States have taken the lead in shaping the information age. Over the last decade, this new technology has sustained American prosperity in a way that has challenged conventional wisdom on economic growth. We are two nations blessed with extraordinary resources and talent. Measured in terms of the industries of tomorrow, we are together defining the partnerships of the future. But our two countries have the potential to do more to shape the character of the global economy in this century. We should turn the example of our own cooperation into a partnership that uses the possibilities of the new technologies for defining new ways of fighting poverty, illiteracy, hunger, disease and pollution. Mr Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, We believe that India and America can -- and should -- march hand in hand towards a world in which economic conditions improve for all. A situation that provides comfortable living standards to one-third of the world's population, but condemns the remaining two-thirds to poverty and want, is unsustainable. The foremost responsibility that the 21st century has cast on all of us is to change this unacceptable legacy of the past. It should be our common endeavour to overcome this legacy. I, therefore, propose a comprehensive global dialogue on development. We would be happy to offer New Delhi as the venue for this dialogue. In this Congress, you have often expressed concern about the future contours of Asia. Will it be an Asia that will be at peace with itself? Or will it be a continent, where countries seek to redraw boundaries and settle claims -- historical of imaginary -- through force? We seek an Asia where power does not threaten stability and security. We do not want the domination of some to crowd out the space for others. We must create an Asia where cooperative rather than aggressive assertion of national self-interests defines behavior among nations. If we want an Asia fashioned on such ideals -- a democratic, prosperous, tolerant, pluralistic, stable Asia -- if we want an Asia where our vital interests are secure, then it is necessary for us to re-examine old assumptions. It is imperative for India and the United States to work together more closely in pursuit of those goals. In the years ahead, a strong, democratic and economically prosperous India, standing at the crossroads of all the major cultural and economic zones of Asia, will be an indispensable factor of stability in the region. Our cooperation for peace and stability requires us to also define the principles of our own engagement. We must be prepared to accommodate our respective concerns. We must have the mutual confidence to acknowledge our respective roles and complementary responsibilities in areas of vital importance to each of us. Security issues have cost a shadow on our relationship. I believe this is unnecessary. We have much in common and no clash of interests. We both share a commitment to ultimately eliminating nuclear weapons. We have both declared voluntary moratoriums on testing. India understands your concerns. We do not wish to unravel your non-proliferation efforts. We wish you to understand our security concerns. We are at a historic moment in our ties. As we embark on our common endeavour to build a new relationship, we must give practical shape to our shared belief that democracies can be friends, partners and allies. In recent years, through all the good and difficult times, we have spoken to each other more often than we have even done in the past. I thank President Clinton for this leadership and vision in steering this dialogue. I sincerely thank members of this Congress for supporting and encouraging this process. As we talk with candor, we open the doors to new possibilities and new areas of cooperation -- in advancing democracy, in combating terrorism, in energy and environment, science and technology and in international peacekeeping. And, we are discovering that our shared values and common interests are leading us to seek a natural partnership of shared endeavors. India and the United States have taken a decisive step away from the past. The dawn of the new century has marked a new beginning in our relations. Let us work to fulfill the promise and the hope of today. Let us remove the shadow of hesitation that lies between us and our joint vision. Let us use the strength of all that we have in common to build together a future that we wish for ourselves and for the world that we live in. Thank you.",223,211,1,Republican,55,45,0,Republican,106
